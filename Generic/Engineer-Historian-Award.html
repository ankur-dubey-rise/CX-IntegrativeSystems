			<p>The ASME History and Heritage Committee recognizes outstanding published work or works by an engineer dealing with the history of mechanical engineering through its Engineer-Historian Award. Preference is given to those publications dealing with the art and science of mechanical engineering. The award is intended to encourage the active interest by mechanical engineers in the history of their profession. The award with its honorarium and certificate is presented annually, if merited, generally at the International Mechanical Engineering Congress.</p>
