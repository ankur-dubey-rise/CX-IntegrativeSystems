            <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
            <p>ASME's product certification programs have grown dramatically. Starting with just two countries in the years prior to 1972, there are now 74 countries in which companies have been certified. ASME is proud that the value of these certification programs has been so widely acknowledged, and that ASME is playing this increasingly vital role in fostering product safety and international commerce.</p>
            <p>The growth of these programs has presented many new opportunities, but also some challenges, especially regarding how to maintain the trademark registrations of ASME's 28 separate Certification Marks across the more than 100 nations in which these marks are currently used on products.</p>
            <p>In order to streamline our multiple marking processes and more effectively manage our numerous global relationships, ASME is pleased to announce the introduction of a new single Certification Mark.</p>
            <p>Instead of 28 separate Certification Marks, there will now be this single comprehensive mark. To maintain a link to the current marks, the new mark will be used in conjunction with a &quot;Certification Designator&quot; to indicate the applicability of the certification. The image shows an example of how the new mark would be used on a nameplate (in this case for a vessel constructed to Section VIII, Division 2).</p>

              <p>ASME will then contact the Certificate Holder's Authorized Inspection Agency (AIA) or ASME designee, as appropriate, and request:</p>
