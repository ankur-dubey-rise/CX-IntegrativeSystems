      <p><strong>Join an ASME Standards &amp; Certification Committee</strong></p>
      <p>Enduring relationships with stakeholders in a broad range of industries have played a key role in ASME's success. Among our most valuable assets are volunteers who serve on our standards development committees.</p>
      <p>Many ASME standards development committees include a range of smaller (subtier) units â€“ subcommittees, subgroups, working groups and project teams that develop, update and maintain ASME's extensive portfolio of standards.</p>

    <p><strong>Membership Criteria</strong></p>
    <p>Committee participation is free, open to anyone with an interest in the subject area and the requisite technical expertise. Membership in ASME is encouraged but not required. Note that committee members are always viewed as individuals, not as representatives of their employers or other organizations.</p>
    <p>Criteria for membership appointments include:</p>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>Your experience and technical qualifications</li>
      <li>Your ability to participate in committee activities</li>
      <li>The business interest of the organization, if any, that supports your committee participation (interest classification)</li>
      <li>Committee size limits </li>
    </ul>
    <p>At the committee's discretion, you may be asked to attend one or more meetings before being considered for membership.</p>
    <p><strong>Types of Membership </strong></p>
    <p>ASME has developed a number of mechanisms in order to maximize the ability of interested parties to participate in its standards development activities.</p>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>The <strong>member</strong> is the traditional means of participating. The member is required to actively participate in committee discussions, work assignments, vote on ballots, and attend meetings.</li>
      <li>The <strong>contributing member</strong> is a classification for individuals interested in contributing to standards development activities, but unable to actively/constantly participate. The contributing member is required to participate in committee discussions and work assignments, but attendance at meetings is optional and is only able to review and comment on ballots.</li>
      <li>The <strong>delegate program</strong> is designed for all parties with a technical interest in specific ASME standards, located outside the U.S. and Canada. Each group applying must be open to membership by qualified experts. The group selects a single individual (delegate) to represent its interests and provide collective group comments on committee standards actions. Delegates must have fluency in the English language and a working knowledge of the technical aspects of the committees work. Delegates, with the support of their group, are expected to comment on proposed revisions, vote on first consideration ballots, and participate on work assignments and committee discussions.</li>
      <li>The <strong>international working group</strong> (IWG) is designed when a diverse group of individuals in a country or region outside the U.S. and Canada express a desire to contribute to the work of a standards development committee. IWG's are created and their members are appointed by the relevant standards development committee just like any other subtier group. IWG's function like any other subtier group that reports to a main standards development committee, but meet regularly in their own country.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>How to Join</strong></p>
    <p>Membership requirements vary by committee, and there may not be openings on the committee of your interest. We recommend contacting the appropriate <a href="http://cstools.asme.org/csconnect/CommitteePages.cfm?view=CFStaffSearch" title="">staff engineer</a> before submitting your membership application. The application process varies by committee, but in all cases you must submit:</p>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>Completed Personnel form (PF-1): <a href="/wwwasmeorg/media/ResourceFiles/AboutASME/Get%20Involved/StandardsCertificationsDevelopmentCommittees/ASME-CS-Personnel-Form.doc" title="">Word version</a>, <a href="http://cstools.asme.org/csconnect/public/MemberProfile.cfm" title="">online version</a>, or <a href="/wwwasmeorg/media/ResourceFiles/AboutASME/Get%20Involved/StandardsCertificationsDevelopmentCommittees/ASME-CS-Personnel-Form.pdf" title="">PDF version</a>. For applicants not currently serving on a C&amp;S committee, the online version is preferred</li>
      <li>A resume or <a href="/wwwasmeorg/media/ResourceFiles/AboutASME/Get%20Involved/StandardsCertificationsDevelopmentCommittees/Biographical-Profile-Form.pdf" title="">completed biographical profile form</a></li>
      <li>A signed <a href="/wwwasmeorg/media/ResourceFiles/AboutASME/Get%20Involved/StandardsCertificationsDevelopmentCommittees/Participation-Acknowledgement-Form.pdf" title="">Participation Acknowledgment Form (PAF)</a>

        <em>Note:</em> applicable only to those who do not already have one on file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some committees require additional information pertinent to their area of expertise. Committee staff engineers will offer further guidance. Applications are acknowledged by ASME staff engineers, who distribute them to committee memberships for consideration. Please note, ASME staff are not responsible for making appointment decisions.</p>
    <p><strong>C&amp;S Connect &amp; Committee Training</strong></p>
    <p>To help members leverage your committee activities, ASME has created a set of <a href="https://www.asme.org/about-asme/standards/standards-certification-member-training-resources/standards-certification-leadership-training" title="">training modules</a> with information on the administrative, procedural and legal aspects of committee participation. Members can use these modules in face-to-face group training or on your own.</p>
    <p>Additionally, it may be requested that C&amp;S Connect and committee training be supplied at a committee meeting, as a separate session(s) or as a web session.</p>
