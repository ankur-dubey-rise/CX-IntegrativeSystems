<h3 class="big">Frequently Asked Questions about Membership Dues and Service Charges</h3>
<p><strong>Why have dues?</strong></p>
<ul class="disc" data-style-removed="position:relative;top:-8px;">
<li>Many of ASME's major activities are totally self-supporting. Others, however, must be partially financed from dues and other income, including section and technical-division support, government relations, research, career guidance and direct services to members.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What portion of ASME revenue is represented by dues?</strong></p>
<ul class="disc" data-style-removed="position:relative;top:-8px;">
<li>Less than 15% of the Society's income is reflected in dues. Dues income is used to support Membership activities including funding to local sections and student section programs and activities; a portion of dues income supports the general fund which helps to offset expenses related to ME magazine, the Washington Office and other activities. Other key sources of income include continuing education courses, technical publication and advertising sales, meetings and exhibits, and, of course, the publication sales of Codes and Standards and its accreditation program revenue.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="module col-md-8 " data-style-removed="position:relative;top:-30px;"> 
<p><strong>How are the current dues set?</strong></p>
<ul class="disc" data-style-removed="position:relative;top:-8px;">
<li>The Board of Governors (BOG) set the dues based on the CPI (Consumer Price Index).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What percentage of dues is used for lobbying?</strong></p>
<ul class="disc" data-style-removed="position:relative;top:-8px;">
<li>ASME estimates that 0.25% of your dues are not deductible because of ASME's lobbying activities on behalf of its members. ASME recommends that you contact your accountant for tax advice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do ASME's dues compare with those of other engineering societies?</strong></p>
<ul class="disc" data-style-removed="position:relative;top:-8px;">
<li>A comparison with those of 12 other engineering societies shows that seven have higher annual dues; in fact, many charge technical-division fees, as well as local, regional, chapter or section fees.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Are my ASME membership dues deductible?</strong></p>
<ul class="disc" data-style-removed="position:relative;top:-8px;">
<li>ASME dues are not deductible as a charitable contribution for federal income tax purposes, but may be deductible as a business expense. ASME estimates that 0.25% of your dues are not deductible because of ASME's lobbying activities on behalf of its members. ASME recommends that you contact your accountant for tax advice.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="disc" data-style-removed="position:relative;top:-8px;">
<li>For households with 2 or more corporate members, the combined dues may be reduced by the portion of one member's dues attributed to the <em>Mechanical Engineering</em> magazine ($39) upon written request or email to the Manager of Membership Development: <a href="mailto:beckj@asme.org?subject=Same Household Discount">beckj@asme.org</a> </li>
</ul>
  <p><strong>Does ASME prorate membership dues during the membership year?</strong></p>
  <ul class="disc" data-style-removed="position:relative;top:-8px;">
