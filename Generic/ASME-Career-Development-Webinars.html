        <p><strong>ASME has partnered with the Engineering Management Institute (EMI) to bring you a series of Career Development Webinars custom-made for Mechanical Engineers.  ASME is proud to announce this new valuable members-only benefit!</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Engineering projects don&rsquo;t just happen because engineers are technically proficient.  They happen also because…</strong></p>


        <ul class="disc" data-style-removed="margin-bottom:13px;margin-left:1%;">
<li>an engineer who was able to <strong>speak effectively</strong> was able to sell the project to a municipality or a private client, or</li>
<li>an engineer who could <strong>communicate well</strong> saved the project in its early stages by working with several parties to overcome challenges, or</li>
<li>an engineer <strong>effectively led</strong> a team to turn an idea into reality.</li>

        </ul>
<p>
These are all <strong>engineering management skills</strong>, but they are harder to come by than you may think.
</p>

<p>
The EMI serves to help engineers become more effective managers and leaders through content, coaching, and training.  Anthony Fasano, PE is the founder of the EMI and will be presenting these Career Development Webinars.
</p>

<p>
The ASME Career Development Webinar series consists of the following topics:
