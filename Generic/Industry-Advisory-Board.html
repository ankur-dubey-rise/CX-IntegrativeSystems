<p>
ASME established the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) in 1987 to help ensure that ASME programs are relevant and effective for its members in industry and to strengthen the Society&rsquo;s ties with industry. 
</p>
<p>
 The majority of ASME&rsquo;s non-student members are employed by industry, representing a wide range of companies, all of which have strong technical components.
</p>
<p>

 The IAB is sustained by the solicitation of ideas and recommendations from its members to benefit <span data-style-removed=font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:#ff9900;">industry, ASME, and the profession</span>.
</p>

  <h2 data-style-removed="padding-removed:0;">Membership</h2>
  <hr data-style-removed="height:auto;height-removed:3px; border:none; color:#000; background-color:#000;">
  
  <p>
The IAB is comprised of industry executives in the C-suites of large, medium, and small companies that employ ASME members. These companies represent the technological diversity aligned with ASME&rsquo;s five core technology areas: Manufacturing, Pressure Technology, Clean Energy, Bioengineering, and Robotics.
</p>
<p>

Membership in the IAB requires the representative of the company to attend meetings in-person twice a year. During these meetings, ASME provides industry executives an opportunity to share their engineering insights into areas beyond their specific industry. This allows them to learn how other companies are developing their engineering processes to keep up with new technological developments and to strengthen their own networks.
</p>
<p>

IAB Member companies also provide their varied perspectives to ASME so ASME can better formulate and execute its vision in support of the profession and improve its global reach in shaping the next generation of engineers.
</p>
<p>

Participation in the IAB is by invitation only. You can download our brochure and contact IAB staff for more information.
