 <p><strong>ASME Standards &amp; Certification Activities</strong></p>

<p>For more than 125 years, industries worldwide have depended on ASME for technically sound, issue-precise standards. In turn, participation by volunteers in the standards development process, supported by their employers, has been a bedrock of ASME Standards &amp; Certification.</p>

<p>Without question, these standards developing activities have made significant contributions to industry. What's important to remember is that participation in the process also benefits the volunteers, their employers and the general public.</p>
