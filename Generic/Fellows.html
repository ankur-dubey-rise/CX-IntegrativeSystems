		<div id="meetCopy">
			<p><strong>Roxann Engelstad:</strong>
Professor Engelstad is an internationally recognized expert on the mechanical issues associated with the design, fabrication, and usage of advanced masks (and processes) for the next-generation lithographic technologies. She has developed a powerful set of numerical tools that correlates nano-scale models to macro-scale models, which track the distortion of the features in the lithographic process. Her research results have been applied to many different types of lithography. As Chair of Mechanical Engineering, she facilitated innovations in communication, career advising, and practical experience that have significantly improved student education.

			<p><strong>John Hawkins:</strong>

				John Hawkins has successfully served in engineering management, engineering, and sales roles in the field of flow borne noise, heat recovery, and exhaust emissions control for industrial engines and gas turbines, heavy truck and bus exhaust systems, as well as noise control of high pressure venting of gases for more than 40 years.  Through design, innovation, streamlined processes, and application tools, he created new markets, market share, and customer acceptance of products ranging from truck and stationary mufflers, specialty catalytic converters, modular 3-way and oxidation catalytic silencers, high pressure vent silencers, and heat recovery systems. John has also served in ASME leadership positions in Section, Region, Global Communities, District, and ASME level committees for more than 35 years.
