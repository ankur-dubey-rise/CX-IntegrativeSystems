		<p><strong>Why should existing members become Participants? </strong>

			<strong>Answer:</strong> Becoming a Participant gives a member the ability to engage with ASME in a new way through our online engineering community. Participants can create Profiles, connect with other individuals with similar interests, and join and create Groups focused on engineering topics, including Groups for official ASME units. With this tool, Participants have the benefit of making their voices heard on the latest in engineering and ASME news while communicating with fellow engineers from around the world, all on one platform. </p>
		<p><strong>Do existing members need to become Participants to access Member Benefits? </strong>

			<strong>Answer:</strong> No, a user does not have to become a Participant in order to access their Member Benefits. A non-converted user will have access to their Member Benefits through an abbreviated dashboard. </p>
		<p><strong>Do existing members need to become Participants to participate in online ASME Groups? </strong>

			<strong>Answer: </strong>Yes, a member will have to become a participant in order to participate in ASME Groups. However, "public" Group content can be viewed by any user. </p>
		<p><strong>Do users have to become Participants in order to purchase a product? </strong>

			<strong>Answer: </strong> No, a user does not have to become a participant in order to purchase a product. Access to ASME products will still be available to ALL ASME users. </p>
		<p><strong>If I don&rsquo;t want to become a Participant, where do I go to renew my membership dues or update my contact information?</strong>

			<strong>Answer:</strong> An unconverted member or customer can go to <a href="http://www.asme.org/" title="http://www.asme.org/">www.asme.org</a> and sign in with the  username and password that they previously used to sign in to their MYASME  Account. They will have access to a Membership &amp; Benefits page that will  provide the option to renew their membership. The user can also update their name,  email address, phone number, and mailing address. </p>
