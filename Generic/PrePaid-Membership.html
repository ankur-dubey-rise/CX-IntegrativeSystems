  <ul class="disc" data-style-removed="margin-removed:1em 0 2em 0;">

    <li>No more worrying &ldquo;Did I renew my  membership or not?&rdquo;</li>
    <li>Protection from future ASME dues  price increases </li>

  </ul>
  <h2 class="fancy-font" data-style-removed="font-size:18px; color:#f26524; margin-removed:0; padding-removed:0; clear:both;">How it Works</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>ASME pre-paid members make a one-time dues payment in an amount determined as a multiple 
    of the members’ age, and the total number of membership years remaining to qualify as a dues-exempt 
    ASME Life Member.*</p>
  <p>Simply send an email using this link to <a href="mailto:CSG@asme.org?subject=Pre-Paid Membership Quote">request a pre-paid membership quote</a>, and an ASME Customer Care Representative will reply promptly with your quote and all the information you need to complete the process – it’s that easy!</p>
  </ul>
 <h2 class="fancy-font" data-style-removed="font-size:18px; color:#f26524; margin-removed:0; padding-removed:0; clear:both;">Example</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>A 32 year old who has been a member for six years would receive a quote of $2,768 USD, (includes all dues 
    and service charges for the next 29 years, and the service charges for all years to follow as a Life Member). <u> That’s a savings of over $1,553 at our current rates!</u>

  <hr />
  <p><strong>What is the difference between Pre-paid Membership and Life Membership?</strong></p>
  <ul class="disc">
    <li><u>Pre-paid</u> is not a grade of membership, but rather a one-time discounted dues payment for the years 
      prior to dues-exempt Life membership eligibility, and the service charges for the years as a Life member. 
      * <u>Life membership</u> is a grade of membership which is achieved when a member has accumulated 35 
      years of paid membership and is retired and/or 65 years of age. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>How would I renew or add annual publication subscriptions, or make my annual contribution to the ASME Foundation? </strong></p>
  <ul class="disc">
    <li>As a pre-paid member, you will continue to receive an annual notice where you can add 
      subscriptions, and/or make your annual Foundation contribution, or you can <a href="/about-asme/get-involved/asme-foundation/make-a-gift">donate now</a>. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Is pre-paid membership available to student members?</strong></p>
  <ul class="disc">
    <li>No, pre-paid membership is only available to (professional) members.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Do the number of years as a member to-date need to be continuous, and do years as a student member count?</strong></p>
  <ul class="disc">
    <li><u>For pre-paid membership</u>, it is the total number of years as a paid member with or without breaks that count. 
      Years as a student member count for those joining for the first time after the year 2000. <u>For Life membership</u>, only years as a paid (professional) member count towards eligibility, with or without 
      breaks. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>I have already renewed my membership through September 2018, do I need to wait until my next renewal to 
    apply for pre-paid membership? </strong></p>
  <ul class="disc">
    <li>No, your current active membership is added to your total number of years as a member and considered in your 
      quote. When the next renewal period begins, you will only receive notices for the purpose of renewing/adding       
      subscriptions and making annual contributions.</li>
