                        <h2>Educational Partners</h2>
                        <p>ASME Learning & Development has established a network of Educational Partners to expand its
                            continuing education activities and learning products to meet the professional development
                            needs of engineers and other technical professionals worldwide. Recognizing that global
                            education and training can be provided more efficiently and affordably by locally trained
                            content experts, ASME now partners with local technical organizations and engineers to
                            develop, market, conduct or deliver training programs for the local market.
                            <br><br>A premier provider of workforce learning solutions for practicing engineers and
                            other technical professionals, ASME Learning & Development seeks continuing education
                            partners to become Authorized Training Providers and Authorized Training Instructors to
                            develop, market and deliver training programs addressing engineering and non-technical
                            subjects worldwide.
