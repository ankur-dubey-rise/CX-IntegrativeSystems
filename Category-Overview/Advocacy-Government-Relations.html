                            <p>One of the public service goals of ASME is to "provide advice to government officials at
                                all levels on engineering and technology matters and policies affecting the public
                                interest, and to develop a climate of understanding and credibility that fosters a
                                continuing dialogue."</p>
                            <p>Very few of the 535 Members of Congress have engineering or scientific backgrounds. Given
                                that they are called upon nearly every day to make decisions that affect scientific and
                                engineering practice, it is only natural that they require the expertise of those
                                experienced in technical fields.</p>
                            <p>ASME Government Relations represents and advocates for the engineering profession by
                                facilitating and initiating various programs and activities. ASME members at all stages
                                of their careers have an opportunity to help "engineer the greater good" by applying
                                their engineering expertise and pragmatic problem-solving approach to the development of
                                sound public policy.</p>

                        <p>Government Relations interacts closely with various members from ASME's Sectors, Groups,
                            Divisions, Committees and Task Forces on all of ASME's policy priorities to keep them
                            apprised of new developments in the policy arena and to provide opportunities for them to
                            offer their technical expertise. Reports are listed on the issue webpages listed above.</p>

                        <p>ASME Capitol Update is a weekly electronic newsletter focused on legislative and regulatory
                            news of interest to the engineering community. It is a free service to ASME members,
                            providing valuable insight on the latest public policy developments from Capitol Hill
                            highlighting issues related to ASME's federal public policy agenda priority issues.</p>

                            on a wide variety of technical issues. Government Relations must work closely with ASME
                            Sector units on the development of position statements.</p>
