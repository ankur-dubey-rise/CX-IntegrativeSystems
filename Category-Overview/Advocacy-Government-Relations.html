<p>One of the public service goals of ASME is to &quot;provide advice to government officials at all levels on engineering and technology matters and policies affecting the public interest, and to develop a climate of understanding and credibility that fosters a continuing dialogue.&quot;</p>

<p>Very few of the 535 Members of Congress have engineering or scientific backgrounds. Given that they are called upon nearly every day to make decisions that affect scientific and engineering practice, it is only natural that they require the expertise of those experienced in technical fields.</p>

<p>ASME Government Relations represents and advocates for the engineering profession by facilitating and initiating various programs and activities. ASME members at all stages of their careers have an opportunity to help &quot;engineer the greater good&quot; by applying their engineering expertise and pragmatic problem-solving approach to the development of sound public policy.</p>

<p><strong>Washington Policy Updates</strong> Government Relations interacts closely with various members from ASME&#39;s Sectors, Groups, Divisions, Committees and Task Forces on all of ASME&#39;s policy priorities to keep them apprised of new developments in the policy arena and to provide opportunities for them to offer their technical expertise. Reports are listed on the issue webpages listed above.</p>

<p><strong><a href="~/about-asme/participate/advocacy-government-relations/policy-publications/capitol-update">Capitol Update</a></strong> ASME Capitol Update is a weekly electronic newsletter focused on legislative and regulatory news of interest to the engineering community. It is a free service to ASME members, providing valuable insight on the latest public policy developments from Capitol Hill highlighting issues related to ASME&#39;s federal public policy agenda priority issues.</p>

<p><strong><a href="~/about-asme/participate/advocacy-government-relations/policy-publications/position-statements">Position Statements</a></strong> Position statements are effective for communicating the independent views of various segments of the Society&mdash;or the Society as a whole&mdash;to policymakers who are confronted with decisions on a wide variety of technical issues. Government Relations must work closely with ASME Sector units on the development of position statements.</p>

<p><strong>Legislative Action Center: Action Alerts</strong><!--

<p><strong><a href="~/about-asme/get-involved/advocacy-government-relations/congressional-briefings-events">Congressional Briefings</a></strong> A key element of ASME&#39;s public policy activities is<strong> </strong>convening congressional briefings to inform Members of<strong> </strong>Congress and their staff about engineering and technology<strong> </strong>aspects of current public policy issues and to increase awareness<strong> </strong>among Congressional staff of ASME as a credible source of technical<strong> </strong>information.</p>

<p><strong><a href="~/about-asme/participate/advocacy-government-relations/washington-visitation-program">Washington Visitation &amp; Congressional District &ldquo;Public Policy Forums&quot;</a></strong> The Washington Visitation Program provides an opportunity for ASME members to actively participate in the Society&#39;s government relations activities. The program enables ASME members to engage in the Society&#39;s public policy agenda and play a role in such national issues as energy policy, global climate change, R&amp;D funding, infrastructure development, and engineering education.</p>

<p><strong><a href="~/about-asme/participate/advocacy-government-relations/federal-fellows-program">ASME Federal Government Fellowship Program</a></strong> The ASME Federal Fellows Program provides opportunities for selected, qualified ASME members to provide technical expertise to policymakers by spending one year in Washington, DC serving in the office of a U.S. Senator or Representative, on a Congressional Committee, or with a federal agency, or in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. ASME accepts applications for the ASME Federal Government Fellowship Program from September through January each year.
