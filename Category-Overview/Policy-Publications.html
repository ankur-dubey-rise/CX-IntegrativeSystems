                        <h4>Position Statements</h4>
                        <p>Position statements are effective for communicating the independent views of various segments
                            of the Society—or the Society as a whole—to policymakers who are confronted with decisions
                            on a wide variety of technical issues. Government Relations must work closely with ASME
                            Sector units on the development of position statements. <a
