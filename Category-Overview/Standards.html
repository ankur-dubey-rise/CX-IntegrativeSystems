<h4>About Codes and Standards</h4>

<div data-style-removed="float-removed:left; width:340px; margin-left:1px;">
<p>ASME is the leading international developer of codes and standards associated with the art, science, and practice of mechanical engineering. Starting with the first issuance of its legendary Boiler &amp; Pressure Vessel Code in 1914, ASME&#39;s codes and standards have grown to nearly 600 offerings currently in print. These offerings cover a breadth of topics, including pressure technology, nuclear plants, elevators / escalators, construction, engineering design, standardization, and performance testing.</p>

<p>Developing and revising ASME codes and standards occurs year-round. More than 4,700 dedicated volunteers &mdash; engineers, scientists, government officials, and others &mdash; contribute their technical expertise to protect public safety, while reflecting best practices of industry. The results of their efforts are being used in over 100 nations; thus setting the standard for code-development worldwide.</p>

<p>ASME develops voluntary standards that enhance public safety, health, and quality of life as well as facilitate innovation, trade, and competitiveness.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>ASME develops and revises standards based on market needs through a consensus process whose meetings dealing with standards-related actions are open to all members of the public. ASME consensus committees are comprised of volunteer subject matter experts from a diverse range of interests, including manufacturers, users, government, and general interest. ASME standards and subsequent revisions are based upon review of reliable technical data by the consensus committee and its sub-tier committees.</p>

<p>The ASME process includes a broad public review for all of its standards actions. Any interested member of the general public may review and comment on proposed ASME standards or revisions, as well as initiate an appeal based on previously submitted concerns. ASME&#39;s voluntary standards may be adopted by jurisdictional authorities as a means of complying with their governing regulatory requirements.</p>

<p>ASME standards are accepted for use in more than 100 countries around the world.</p>
