                                <p>The ordinary pressure of the air surrounding us is 14.7 pounds per square inch, but
                                    the pressure can change when the wind blows or an object, like a car or airplane,
                                    accelerates.</p>

                                <p>One important principle to remember is that wherever the air pressure is higher,
                                    there will be a stronger force or push against an object. It&rsquo;s also helpful to
                                    know that when an air particle speeds up, it actually &ldquo;pushes&rdquo; less.
                                    Imagine that fast-moving air particles are in so much of a hurry that they
                                    don&rsquo;t have time to apply force. This principle is used in airplane wings to
                                    make planes fly. When a plane moves along the runway, the air above the wing speeds
                                    up more, lowering the pressure, so that the air below the wing can push the plane
                                    upward.<br />

                                <p><strong>Water Glass Trick.</strong> Fill a cup one-third with water. Cover the entire
                                    mouth with an index card. Holding the card in place, take the cup to the sink and
                                    turn it upside down. Remove your hand from underneath. Voil√†! Because the water
                                    inside the cup is lighter than the air outside, the card is held in place by about
                                    15 pounds of force from the air pushing up, while the force of the water pushing
                                    down is only about one pound of force.</p>

                                <p><strong>Fountain Bottle.</strong> Fill a 2-liter soda bottle half full of water. Take
                                    a long straw and insert it in the mouth. Wrap a lump of clay around the straw to
                                    form a seal. Blow hard into the straw&mdash;then stand back. Your blowing increases
                                    the air pressure inside the sealed bottle. This higher pressure pushes on the water
                                    and forces it up and out the straw.</p>

                                <p><strong>Ping-Pong Funnel.</strong> Put a ping-pong ball inside the wide part of a
                                    funnel and blow hard into the narrow end. Why doesn&rsquo;t the ball pop out? As you
                                    blow into the funnel, the air moves faster and lowers the air pressure underneath
                                    the ball. Because the air pressure is higher above the ball than below it, the ball
                                    is pushed down into the funnel&mdash;no matter how hard you blow or which direction
                                    you point the funnel.</p>

                                <p><strong>The Million Dollar Bet.</strong> Take an empty water or soda bottle and lay
                                    it down horizontally on a table. Roll a piece of paper towel into a small ball about
                                    half the size of the opening. Tell a friend you&rsquo;ll pay $1 million if he or she
                                    can blow the ball into the bottle. Don&rsquo;t worry about losing money because this
                                    is impossible. No matter how hard someone blows to try to force more air into the
                                    bottle, there&#39;s no room for it, so it will flow right out, pushing away the
                                    paper ball.</p>

                                <p><strong>Kissing Balloons.</strong> Blow up two balloons and attach a piece of string
                                    to each. Hold one balloon by the string in each hand and position the two balloons
                                    so that they are at your nose level and 6 inches apart. Blow hard into the space
                                    between the balloons. This lowers the air pressure. The pressure of the surrounding
                                    air is now higher and it will push the balloons together.</p>
