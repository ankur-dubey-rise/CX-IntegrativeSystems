                            <p>The stability of the electric grid affects millions of residential and business
                                customers. One blip&mdash;amounting to just seconds&mdash;can interrupt critical systems
                                across a city or an entire region.</p>

                            <p >Maintaining grid stability is a challenge as utilities rush to add renewable
                                power to their generating portfolio. The business case for renewables is undeniable: as
                                prices for wind turbines and solar panels keep dropping and the costs of installation go
                                down, renewable electricity becomes some of the cheapest power available. But the
                                inherently inconsistent nature of solar and wind energy has grid operators looking for
                                new ways to seamlessly integrate their output into the system.</p>

                                        href="~/about-asme/mechanical-engineering-magazine/energy-special-report-june-2018">June
                                        2018 Energy Special Report</a></strong></p>

                            <p >This challenge is being faced around the world, and in the U.S. it is
                                playing out initially in California. A law passed by the California legislature in 2015
                                mandated utilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the capacity of
                                renewable projects. In response, the California Independent System Operator, CAISO,
                                began seeing solar power provide an increasing share of electricity in the middle of
                                sunny days. By 3:00 PM each day, however, the sun begins to sink toward the horizon and
                                the power provided by the state&rsquo;s solar projects also starts to fall off&mdash;and
                                this loss in power happens just as daily electricity demand starts to rise.</p>

                            <p >To meet that demand, California utilities figured they would turn to natural
                                gas-fired peaking plants that could ramp up quickly. Southern California Edison, one of
                                the state&rsquo;s three major electric utilities, owns five such peaking plants.</p>

                            <p >In 2015, however, a massive leak of natural gas from underground storage
                                wells at Aliso Canyon threw that strategy into question. The leak&mdash;the worst in
                                U.S. history&mdash;threatened the reliability of fuel for those gas-fired peaking
                                plants, and the California Public Utilities Commission ordered SCE to quickly build an
                                energy storage project to mitigate the supply loss.</p>

                            <p >The utility turned to battery storage. In January 2017, utility officials
                                opened two 10-MW battery systems supplied by Tesla at its Mira Loma substation that can
                                store 80 MWh of renewable energy, one of the largest battery storage projects in the
                                country. Today utilities and systems operators are recognizing battery storage as one of
                                a number of effective tools for managing an increasingly interactive electric grid
                                powered by more and more renewable energy projects. These tools will have to respond
                                quickly to the sharply rising demand and must scale so as to add gigawatts of power in
                                as little as an hour.</p>

                            <p >For an industry that had relied on large and lumbering baseload power
                                plants, these sorts of fast and flexible systems may feel like a shaky foundation to
                                support critical energy infrastructure. But the new energy paradigm promises to be
                                cheaper and cleaner than anything that has come before.</p>


                            <h2 >The Duck Curve</h2>

                            <p >Over the course of a typical weekday, the electrical load follows a regular
                                pattern. After a lull in the middle of the night, demand for electricity ramps up
                                between 5:00 am and 9:00 am. From then, demand often stays fairly constant until the
                                late afternoon or early evening, when residential lighting and air conditioning overlaps
                                with the last few hours of the business day. The load only begins to decline around 9:00
                                PM as stores close and early risers head to bed. (The load curve changes on the weekend
                                and over the course of the year, with August seeing the highest peak demand and April
                                the lowest.)</p>

                            <p >Traditionally, the rise and fall of the load was met via a combination of
                                baseload power generation from coalfired or nuclear power plants and nimble peaking
                                plants or dispatchable power from hydroelectric dams. But the addition of wind and solar
                                power to the energy mix has altered the calculus. Wind, for instance, often blows most
                                steadily in the middle of the night when demand is at its lowest. In regions where there
                                are a large number of wind farms, deliverable wind power can at times be greater than
                                the total demand.</p>

                            <p >Solar power can be more predictable than wind&mdash;on sunny days, the sun
                                shines most strongly in the middle of the day&mdash;but it creates its own challenges to
                                the load curve. Solar power generation ramps up in the morning and stays constant until
                                mid-afternoon before fading for the last few hours before sunset. Unfortunately, that
                                diminishing power supply corresponds with the rising load in the late afternoon, meaning
                                the net load&mdash;the difference between electricity demand and the portion met by
                                solar power&mdash;rises even faster than the actual load. That means peaking power has
                                to be added, and fast.</p>

                            <p >Back in 2008, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory traced
                                out the net load curve as it responded to more and more solar power being added to the
                                grid. One wag noted that in time the curve looked like the back of a duck: high like the
                                tail in the morning, sagging down in midday, then sharply up along the neck in the late
                                afternoon and only rounding over the top of the head and bill in the evening. From that
                                point on, that net load profile was referred to as the &ldquo;duck curve.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p >In California, the middle is sagging ever deeper and the neck is growing
                                even steeper as the state leads the way in mandating more renewables. By 2030 renewables
                                must account for 50 percent of each of the state&rsquo;s large investor-owned
                                utilities&rsquo; generation portfolio.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;Those are aggressive renewable goals,&rdquo; said Vibhu Kaushik, SCE
                                director of grid technology and modernization. &ldquo;Renewables have a lot of
                                intermittency in them. Batteries can change momentarily to balance and maintain
                                reliability. It is not the only thing, but storage for integration will be a big chunk
                                of flattening the curve.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p >While the utilities are required to increase their mix of renewables, CAISO
                                manages the grid and is responsible for integrating that power into the state&rsquo;s
                                grid. At present, the system now comprises just under 30 percent of renewable sources.
                                Of that, 48 percent is generated by solar power.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;Our job is to maintain reliability and renewables are just one part,&rdquo; said
                                Peter Klauer, CAISO senior advisor for smart grid technology. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
                                favor one technology over another. But there is a lot of solar generation hitting the
                                grid and that presents an operating challenge to balance with other resources.&rdquo;
                            </p>

                            <p >CAISO looks at many ways to find the highest value of its assets at the
                                lowest cost. Klauer notes battery storage is just one way to do that. Shipping excess
                                energy outside of the grid to neighboring states and connections is more effective.</p>

                            <p >Curtailing demand from renewables also is an option, and has been
                                CAISO&rsquo;s most effective tool for managing oversupply. But that results in the state
                                not using all of the renewable energy it could be generating.</p>

                            <p >According to CAISO data, in 2016 the system operator was forced to curtail
                                more than 308,000 MWh of renewables, up from 187,000 MWh the year before. Most of that
                                came in the form of economic curtailments: During times of oversupply, the bulk energy
                                market competitively selects the lowest-cost power sources. Renewables can bid into the
                                system in a way to reduce production when prices start to fall and CAISO&rsquo;s market
                                optimization software automatically adjusts supply with demand.</p>

                            <p >Curtailing renewables runs counter to the state&rsquo;s economic and
                                environmental goals, notes Klauer. As costs for lithium ion batteries come down, battery
                                storage &ldquo;is helpful, and can alleviate the rush of solar during the day,&rdquo; he
                                said.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;The whole energy world is shifting,&rdquo; noted Mark Frigo, vice
                                president of energy storage North America at E.ON Climate and Renewables North America,
                                part of global energy developer E.ON. The company has 2,700 MW of renewable projects in
                                the U.S. &ldquo;One factor is cost-effective renewables. But the increasing
                                electrification requires a high quality of electricity and a decentralized
                                demand-response system to deliver. Things are much more complex than ever before.
                                That&rsquo;s where battery storage can come into play.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p >Battery storage can solve several simultaneous problems, from maintaining
                                grid stability to deferred transmission and distribution. It provides both supply and
                                load, although batteries are limited in how long they can produce power.</p>

                            <p >Operating batteries is not as simple as flipping the switch. It requires
                                utilities to buy electricity in advance to charge the batteries, and at a low price so
                                that the value of discharge is greater than the value of charging.</p>

                            <p >SCE&rsquo;s emergency 10-MW project has supplied power every day since being
                                commissioned, the utility reports. It now has 400 MW of storage in its portfolio mix,
                                including long-running pumped-storage hydroelectric plants. But in an innovative twist,
                                it also is using batteries to supplement gas-fired peaking plants and respond to the
                                state&rsquo;s frequency regulation market.</p>

                            <p >Peakers are linked to the frequency regulation market, but because they are
                                nonspinning, they can take as long as 10 minutes to go online.</p>

                            <p >Adding batteries that can react immediately while the gas turbines are
                                starting makes the entire unit eligible for spinning reserve status&mdash;that is,
                                capacity immediately available to the grid and thus more valuable.</p>

                            <p >Last year, SCE partnered with GE and Wellhead Power Solutions to install an
                                11-MW, 4.3-MWh battery at two substations, pairing them with a 50-MW gas-fired peaking
                                plant. The utility calls the Hybrid Enhanced Gas Turbine the world&rsquo;s first
                                low-emission hybrid battery storage system to be fitted with a gas-fired peaker.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;These relatively small batteries unlock a lot of value with existing
                                plants,&rdquo; Kaushik said. &ldquo;The batteries are always synched to the grid and
                                provide power at a moment&rsquo;s notice until the peaker comes on line.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p >Over the 40-year life of the plant the batteries are also projected to
                                reduce operating costs for the turbines by 60 percent.</p>

                            <p >There is a lot to like about battery storage, Kaushik said. &ldquo;For a
                                small capital investment, you can add value to the grid and so much more,&rdquo; he
                                said. &ldquo;They are modular, easily stacked. It is a game-changing technology.&rdquo;
                            </p>

                            <p >And batteries are getting cheaper. A recent analysis by Lazard pegs the cost
                                of lithium ion batteries used for peaker replacement between $282 to $347 per MWh, with
                                costs projected to drop by 36 percent over the next five years.</p>

                            <p >Those declining costs will entice more utilities and systems operators to
                                add installed battery capacity, though Kaushik sees more value in hybrid applications,
                                except in locations where congestion pricing on the grid is high.</p>

                            <p >In Gaildorf, Germany, about 65 km northeast of Stuttgart, a private
                                developer is using another hybrid concept, pairing a wind-power station with
                                pumped-storage hydroelectricity. Max Bögl Wind AG has built four 12 MW wind turbines
                                atop 40 m tall concrete tanks on top of 200 m high hills. The tanks will eventually
                                serve as the upper reservoir for the pumped hydro power plant, holding enough water to
                                produce 70 MWh of electricity with a peak output of 16 MW. When completed later this
                                year, the storage component will have a response time within 30 seconds.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;Pumped storage is a proven technology and this has a design life of
                                about 50 years,&rdquo; said Susanne Kleineheismann of Max Bögl Wind. Batteries, she
                                points out, must be replaced after about eight to 10 years. The company will not release
                                project costs, reportedly at $81 million, but Kleineheismann says capital costs for what
                                the firm calls a &ldquo;water battery&rdquo; will be 300 to 400 Euros per kWh.</p>

                            <p >Pumped hydro is not an option at sea level, so for offshore wind projects,
                                electrochemical batteries still make sense. In March, Bay State Wind announced a
                                partnership with NEC Energy Solutions to add 55 MW and 110 MWh of battery storage to a
                                planned 800-MW offshore wind farm 15 miles off of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, Mass. Bay
                                State claims the combination will help reduce Massachusetts winter electricity prices by
                                some $158 million per year. In the U.K., Danish power company Ørsted said it will
                                install a 2-MW battery to provide frequency regulation at its offshore 90-MW Burbo Bank
                                wind farm. And the world&rsquo;s first floating wind farm, Norwegian energy giant
                                Statoil&rsquo;s 30-MW Hywind complex, will be fitted with a 1.3 MWh battery system.</p>

                            <p >In a show of the flexibility and potential of battery storage, the electric
                                car company Tesla installed a 100-MW station in South Australia last year in the wake of
                                widespread outages, after a bet by Tesla&rsquo;s Elon Musk that the firm could have the
                                station built and operational within 100 days. The station can respond to power outages
                                within 140 ms and competes with natural-gas plants for peaking power and frequency
                                regulation services. Grid operator Australian Energy Market Operator reports lower
                                prices being bid into the system since the battery plant&rsquo;s startup.</p>

                            <p >Another way to smooth out the duck curve is to increase demand during the
                                day, instead of tossing out the excess renewable energy. SCE, as part of its plan to
                                meet California&rsquo;s energy and environmental mandates, thinks much of that wasted
                                energy can be deflected to charging stations as electric vehicles gain market share.</p>

                            <p >In Columbia, Mo., Columbia Power &amp; Light Co. last year started to pay
                                higher rebates for solar arrays facing west rather than south. The move is an effort to
                                bring solar production more in line with peak demand, as west-facing solar panels
                                produce more power later in the day when demand picks up.</p>

                            <p >Batteries and storage now are getting a boost from the Federal Energy
                                Regulatory Commission. In January it approved an order directing operators of wholesale
                                markets to devise market rules for energy storage in wholesale, capacity and ancillary
                                services. The rules, scheduled to be developed and implemented in two years, should
                                codify how energy storage can be applied across the country, establishing market-driven
                                parameters. That will change how the market has developed until now, driven by state
                                regulatory demands. California, New York, and Massachusetts are already ahead of the
                                ruling, and Texas is following suit.</p>

                            <p >Texas does not yet have California&rsquo;s duck curve, but E.ON&rsquo;s
                                Frigo says most parts of the country will soon face the challenge of integrating
                                renewable power. &ldquo;The renewable train has left the station,&rdquo; Frigo said.
                                &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see much greater numbers of renewables on the grid. Fossils will be
                                retired. But that brings challenges of intermittency so you will see the duck curve
                                elsewhere. Here&rsquo;s where energy storage plays as a good solution.</p>
