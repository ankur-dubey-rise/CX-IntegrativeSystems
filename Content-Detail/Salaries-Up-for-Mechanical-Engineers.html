                                <p>Salaries are rising, according to a new ASME survey that shows the median total
                                    primary compensation for mechanical engineers in 2016 is $124,000. This builds on
                                    information showing base salaries have risen between 3.5 percent and 5 percent per
                                    year from 2013 to 2016.</p>

                                <p>Experience counts too. Those MEs with more than twenty years of experience have a
                                    median income of $144,644. But <a

                                        engineers</a> should not complain. The survey shows those beginning their
                                    careers earned a median primary income of $73,079. More than nine in 10 full-time ME
                                    employees are offered health insurance by their employers.</p>

                                <p>The <a
                                        href="https://www.asme.org/about-asme/professional-membership/member-benefits/salary-services">2017
                                        Salary Survey</a> of ASME members measured only salaries and compensation in the
                                    U.S. Responses were garnered from 1,661 members, or 3.4 percent of those queried.
                                    The results reflect changes from the <a

                                <h3>Income by length of experience, 2017 vs. 2013 (full-time salaried only)</h3>
                                <p>Compensation varies depending on multiple factors, including education, experience,
                                    disciplines, geography, and gender. The typical respondent is a white male in his
                                    late forties with at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree who has been employed in an
                                    engineering-related positon for 20 or more years, including senior-level
                                    responsibility with supervisory tasks.</p>

                                <p>Those with a Ph.D earned the highest median income of $155,000, followed by those
                                    with either an MBA or Master&rsquo;s degree in mechanical or other engineering
                                    discipline, at $125,000 or more. The largest percentage of respondents said their
                                    highest degree is a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering, earning a median
                                    income of $118,000.</p>

                                <p>Mechanical engineers with a <a
                                        href="http://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/workforce-development/4-leading-job-areas-hydraulics">professional
                                        engineers</a> license earned a median income of $133,000, nearly $16,000 more
                                    than those lacking the PE license.</p>

                                <p>&ldquo;It is an exciting time to be an engineer,&rdquo; says Charla K. Wise,
                                    president of ASME. &ldquo;The demand for engineers continues to grow, and many
                                    stimulating job opportunities are emerging.&rdquo;</p>
                      
                      
                        
                           
                                <h3>Lucrative</h3>
                                <p>The most lucrative areas are in nuclear, petroleum, chemical, utilities, and
                                    consulting practices, according to the survey. Mechanical engineers with training in
                                    nuclear and petroleum/chemical disciplines earned the highest median income of
                                    $145,000 and $144,000, respectively. Conversely, those with academic training in
                                    computer science/engineering and mathematics earned the least, at $92,181 and
                                    $100,509, respectively.</p>

                                <p>The results confirm strong demand for engineering services, especially in petroleum
                                    and offshore oil production. The authors also point to <a
                                        href="http://nuclearengineering.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=2583228">nuclear
                                        engineering</a>, where the power industry wants engineers knowledgeable in in
                                    modular systems and other new and nontraditional technologies that could bring
                                    electric power to countries in need.</p>

                                <p>Among ethnicity types, Asian or Pacific Islanders showed a median income of $130,000,
                                    while Hispanic respondents earned a median primary income of $119,750.</p>

                                <p>Increasing demand for engineering services in overseas markets, especially in China
                                    where energy and transportation development continues at a fast pace, pushes higher
                                    salaries in those markets. But they do not reflect a labor shortage in the U.S.,
                                    according to the survey.</p>
                     
                      
                      
                            
                                <h3>Male-Female Wage Gap</h3>
                                <p>The <a
                                        href="https://www.asme.org/career-education/articles/career-and-education/macgyvering-the-gender-gap">gender
                                        gap</a> also is apparent as the median primary income for females responding to
                                    the survey trailed those of men, $103,500 to $125,000. &nbsp;The survey notes male
                                    respondents have been employed longer in an engineering-related position, a likely
                                    factor in the discrepancy in incomes. An overwhelming 92 percent of survey
                                    respondents were male. That reflects ASME&rsquo;s membership; worldwide, 6 percent
                                    of ASME members are female.</p>

                                <p>Not surprisingly, compensation also correlates between job levels and functions. MEs
                                    in the role of executive, president, or owner had the highest median income,
                                    $227,500. Those at the next level of director or vice presidents showed $175,000.
                                    Junior engineers earned $70,850.</p>

                                <p>For those whose roles were identified as general and <a
                                        href="https://www.asme.org/career-education/articles/career-development/is-management-for-me">technical
                                        management</a>, primary income is reported at $160,000 and $149,753,
                                    respectively.</p>

                         
                     
                   
                         
                                <h3>Regionally</h3>
                                <p>Regionally, the survey follows the nine U.S. census divisions. Those in the West
                                    South Central, South Atlantic, New England, Pacific and Mountain regions reported
                                    income above the national level. Those is the East South Central, East North Central
                                    and West North Central reported primary income of $115,000 or less.</p>

                                <p>New Mexico, New Hampshire and Florida reported the highest incomes, $157,400,
                                    $148,550 and $147,813, respectively. Mississippi, Nebraska and Tennessee have the
                                    lowest incomes, $91,615, $95,500 and $99,878, respectively.</p>

                                <p>For metropolitan areas, the highest salaries reported are in Hartford, CT, $158,500;
                                    Los Angeles/Long Beach, $155,811; San Jose, CA, $155,000; and Albuquerque, NM,
                                    $153,783. The lowest median incomes are in Grand Rapids, MI, $99,000; Salt Lake
                                    City, UT, $99,200; and Louisville, KY, $104,500. Many of the highest incomes were
                                    reported along the East and West coasts.</p>

                                <p>The survey, designed to be <a
                                        href="https://www.asme.org/about-asme/professional-membership/member-benefits/salary-services">interactive</a>
                                    with individual engineers, is available online. Results are entered into two
                                    distinct interactive salary calculators.&nbsp; The Regression Salary Calculator uses
                                    regression analysis, allowing one to calculate individual results for thousands of
                                    possible employment situations.&nbsp; The Searchable Survey Data Tool allows the
                                    user to create customized aggregations of the survey results.&nbsp; These salary
                                    calculators will enable mechanical engineers to compute their salary based on their
                                    very specific, individual circumstances, location, experience, licensing&rsquo;s,
                                    and others.&nbsp; The salary survey will be repeated annually to update the
                                    calculators with the most up to date data accordingly.</p>

                                <p>For comparison, a 2017 survey of civil engineers by the American Society of Civil
                                    Engineers found the median pre-tax income in 2016 for civil engineers was $101,000.
                                    Base salaries rose between 4 percent and 5 percent each year since 2014, according
                                    to the survey. Professional licensure increases the median salary to $108,000. Civil
                                    engineers with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree have a median salary of $93,000; those with
                                    a Master&rsquo;s degree earn $101,100. The male-female pay gap also exists for civil
                                    engineers; female civils earn $83,000 compared to $101,400 for male respondents.</p>
                                

                                <p>Despite discrepancies, mechanical engineering remains an attractive field where
                                    qualified engineers continue to be in demand and are rewarded for their work.</p>
