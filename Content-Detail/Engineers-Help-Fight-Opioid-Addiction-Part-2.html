                            <p class="mt-2">Chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans and its causes include
                                everything from
                                neuropathic pain from spine disorders, to <a

                                    nerve pain</a>, to chronic migraine, which affects as many as 30 million patients in
                                the U.S. alone.</p>


                            <p class="mt-2">Other sources of chronic pain are post-surgical and post-amputation pain
                                caused by trauma
                                to the severed nerves at the amputation or surgical sites. These two types of pain
                                impact nearly 500,000 Americans each year, and most of these patients are being treated
                                with pharmaceuticals and other traditional pain management methods.</p>

                                    pain market</a> is a large market, and the market drivers are really diabetes and
                                peripheral vascular disease,&rdquo; says Jon Snyder, CEO of Neuros Medical, a startup
                                based in Cleveland that has licensed the kilohertz neurostimulation technology from Case
                                Western since 2009, using it in its Altius treatment system. &ldquo;They&#39;re
                                projecting market numbers basically to double by the year 2050, so this will continue to
                                be a really underserved market that needs new solutions.&rdquo;</p>


                            <p class="mt-2">The Neuros system consists of an implantable generator that&rsquo;s about
                                the size of a pacemaker, with an integrated rechargeable battery, cuff electrode, and
                                external controllers that allow the patient and their doctor to manage the system
                                remotely. It is installed in the body alongside the peripheral nerve that needs
                                treatment. When the patient needs pain relief they simply switch the system on, with
                                what looks like a small television remote, for an automated treatment session of 30
                                minutes. Once that&rsquo;s over, the system shuts down and the nerve itself comes right
                                back on and starts transmitting again as normal, though the effects of treatment have
                                been show to linger well after treatment ends.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2">&ldquo;Our system produces a high-frequency electrical signal in the 5-10
                                kHz range that&#39;s directed via the nerve cuff lead, which is placed around a nerve or
                                targeted set of nerves that we&#39;re looking to block,&rdquo; Snyder says. &ldquo;It
                                stops the potassium channels from opening and closing, so the nerve is rendered
                                intransmissible. It&rsquo;s very similar to the effect of lidocaine on the nerve, as far
                                as what&#39;s happening.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p class="mt-2">The only functional difference is that <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/treating-body-mind-epilepsy-patients">neurostimulation</a>
                                achieves this effect via an electrical nerve block, whereas lidocaine is based on a
                                chemical nerve block. According to the company&rsquo;s internal testing, the treatment
                                has shown pain reduction of about 75 percent to 80 percent, along with narcotic pain
                                medication reduction of about 90 percent.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2">Other commercial uses for kilohertz frequency alternative current blocking
                                include the vBloc Therapy system, which is making use of the technology to partially
                                block the vagus nerve in the digestive tract to help control obesity, as well as Nevro,
                                used to treat chronic back and leg pain.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2">&ldquo;The body is a natural system,&rdquo; Bhadra says. &ldquo;This is what
                                biomedical engineers do. We come up with things that work on that million-year-old
                                system and get results.&rdquo;</p>
