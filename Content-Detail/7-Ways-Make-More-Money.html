                <p>The median pay for mechanical engineers in 2017 was $85,880 per year, or about $41
                    per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the typical entry-level
                    education required is a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. There were 288,800 mechanical
                    engineering jobs in the U.S., with a projected job growth rate of 9 percent through
                    2026, in 2016, the last year the BLS counted.</p>

                <p>Not a bad salary or growth prospects, but there are always ways for mechanical
                    engineers to increase <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/technology-and-society/salaries-up-for-mechanical-engineers"
                        title="Salaries Are Up for Mechanical Engineers">their salaries</a>. Most
                    approaches require planning and a significant investment in time, money, and
                    education, as well as excellent communication and sometimes negotiation skills.</p>

                <p>Here are a few of the best ways to start boosting your engineering salary.</p>

                <h3>1) Earn a Master&rsquo;s Degree</h3>

                <p>A master&rsquo;s degree is increasingly required to advance into higher-paying
                    supervisory and management roles. It sharpens your technical skills and can
                    establish you as an expert in a hot field, such as additive manufacturing and 3D
                    printing. &ldquo;Becoming a technical expert in a particular industry or product
                    will command a higher salary than being a generalist engineer,&rdquo; says Tom
                    Goettl, vice president and principal recruiter for Konik PrimeStaff, a leading
                    engineering recruiting company based in Edina, MN.</p>

                            Education Should Never End</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>

                <h3>2) Earn an MBA</h3>

                <p>If you are interested in management opportunities, a Master of Business
                    Administration degree might be the best approach. <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/career-education/articles/career-and-education/mba-or-not-to-mba"
                        title="To MBA or Not to MBA">An MBA is ideal</a> for mechanical engineers with
                    an aptitude for business management. &nbsp;<br />
                    <br />
                    &ldquo;The skills that come with an MBA enable engineers to be promoted into
                    business oversight roles,&rdquo; Goettl says.&nbsp;&ldquo;They will learn, for
                    example, how to tie profit and loss statements from the entire company into an
                    engineering department and how every department&rsquo;s performance affects the
                    company bottom line.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>He does caution that management is not always a good fit for engineers.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Many great engineers move into management roles only to learn afterwards that
                    they dislike holding others accountable, or coaching and leading teams,&rdquo; he
                    says.&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to spend the rest of your career in a role
                    you&rsquo;re not passionate about simply because the pay is a bit higher.&rdquo;</p>

                <h3>3) Become a PE</h3>

                <p>Professional engineers (PE) tend to move into higher-paying supervisory and
                    management jobs than non-PEs because only PEs can sign and seal engineering drawings
                    or serve as a fully qualified expert witnesses. Obtaining a PE license shows you are
                    serious about your profession and are part of an elite group of engineers. Also, an
                    increasing number of government agencies, educational institutions, and
                    private-sector clients prefer to only work with licensed professional engineers.</p>

                <h3>4) Internal Development Opportunities</h3>

                <p>Does your company have upcoming special projects such as a system conversion, or need
                    someone to travel for a customer visit? <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/technology-and-society/5-reasons-engineers-give-back"
                        title="5 Reasons for Engineers to Give Back">Volunteering</a> for these projects
                    will be remembered in your next merit review.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Employees who are viewed as helping out wherever needed will be looked at for
                    future promotions and salary increases,&rdquo; Goettl says. &ldquo;These projects
                    will also stretch your technical abilities such as coding, Excel, and project
                    management.&nbsp; In the event of a company layoff, you&rsquo;ll either be
                    irreplaceable at your current company, or much more attractive to another.&nbsp;Your
                    proven ability to help out wherever needed will be taken into consideration in your
                    next salary discussion.&rdquo;</p>

                <h3>5) Change Your Engineering Industry</h3>

                <p>According to the BLS, the median annual wages in 2017 for mechanical engineers in the
                    top industries were:</p>

                            <tr>

                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                </div>
                <p>A simple shift from machinery manufacturing to scientific R&amp;D (such as robotics,
                    medical devices, pharmaceutical), for example, can earn an ME an extra $21,000 per
                    year.</p>
                <h3>6) Change Your State</h3>
                <p>Pay levels from MEs vary widely from state to state. States that have reputations for
                    high-tech fields like aerospace, defense, biotechnology, robotics, IT, and
                    biomedicine have average salaries close to $100,000 (Massachusetts $96,010; Maryland
                    $104,250; Virginia $100,850; California $104,030).<br />
                    <br />
                    An engineer can get a big salary bump just by moving one state over. An ME in Iowa,
                    for example, earned an average of $74,120 in 2017, one of the lowest salaries in the
                    country. But next door in Illinois the average salary for an ME was $92,040. Earning
                    that extra $18,000 a year over a 30-year time period equates to about $540,000.</p>

                <h3>7) Ask for a Raise</h3>

                <p>Getting more money could be as easy as asking for a raise, especially if you know you
                    are underpaid or have performed especially well. But this, as you can guess, can be
                    a stressful process. According to <em>Huffington Post</em> article <a
                        href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-ask-for-a-raise-in-2018-according-to-the-professionals_us_5a53b01ee4b0efe47ebb76cc"
                        target="_blank" title="How To Ask For A Raise In 2018, According To The Professionals">How to
                        Ask for a Raise in 2018</a>, key factors are doing salary research for your
                    market, being prepared, and keeping expectations realistic. Most annual raises are
                    between 1 and 5 percent. Also consider asking for a bonus when asking for a raise.
                </p>

                <p><strong>How Much $$$?</strong></p>

                <p>Exactly how much of an increase will these extra efforts have on your base salary? In
                    most cases, mechanical engineers who obtain a Master&rsquo;s, MBA, or PE can expect
                    a 10 percent to 15 percent increase in their salaries. An engineer with an MBA may
                    also be a strong future candidate for the role of engineering director or vice
                    president of engineering.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Once you&rsquo;ve volunteered for special projects and proven you&rsquo;re a
                    strong asset to the company, merit increases will be higher as well,&rdquo; Goettl
                    says.&nbsp;&ldquo;Typical merit increases are 2 to 5 percent and those with stronger
                    reviews will be rewarded on the higher end of that range. Also, keep in mind that
                    next year&rsquo;s merit increase will be based off your higher salary, so after a
                    few years, the extra initiatives you&rsquo;ve taken on can really pay off in the
                    long run.&rdquo;<br />
