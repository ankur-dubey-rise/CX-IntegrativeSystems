                                <p>Mushrooms can delight the palate, be turned into packaging, and knock you dead. Now
                                    they have a new power&mdash;generate electricity by working as the substrate for a
                                    bacteria and graphene energy system. Call it the world&rsquo;s first bionic
                                    mushroom.</p><br>

                                <p>&ldquo;When you go down on the size scale, both the biological and non-biological
                                    worlds have cool properties,&rdquo; said Manu Mannoor, an assistant professor of
                                    mechanical engineering at the Stevens Institute of Technology.</p><br>

                                <p>&nbsp;In particular, cyanobacteria are known for their ability to photosynthesize and
                                    graphene is known to conduct electricity.</p><br>

                                <p>&ldquo;We were looking for a way to somehow merge these two worlds and create
                                    something in the macroworld so we can access them.&rdquo;</p><br>

                                <p>&nbsp;To do that, they needed a mushroom.</p>

                                <p>When cyanobacteria photosynthesize there is a moment before the sun&rsquo;s energy is
                                    converted to sugars when electrons are produced. To access those electrons, Mannoor
                                    and his team planned to lay a grid of graphene nanoribbons across seams of the
                                    bacteria. To do so, though, they had to keep the bacteria alive. Previous
                                    researchers hoping to exploit cyanobacteria&rsquo;s energy conversion powers have
                                    had trouble doing that. In the natural world, cyanobacteria thrive in warm still
                                    waters. But on things like silicon, they perish. Manoor thought a mushroom might
                                    make a friendlier home for the bacteria.</p><br>

                                <p>They found that atop a specimen of <em>agaricus bisporus, </em>or the button
                                    mushroom, the bacteria stayed alive. Mannoor and his team were able to 3D print a
                                    spiral of densely packed cyanobacteria onto the head of the mushroom. A matrix of
                                    graphene nanoribbons&mdash;mixed with a conductive polymer to make a conductive 3D
                                    printable ink&mdash;were then printed over the bacteria. The ink, when it contacted
                                    the bacteria, sucked away electrons.</p><br>

                                <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;There are tiny things which are penetrating into the cells,&rdquo;
                                    Mannoor said. &ldquo;The electricity is collected and wired down through the stem of
                                    the mushroom.&rdquo;</p><br>

                                        href="https://www.asme.org/career-education/articles/career-and-education/engineers-can-resolve-conflict-save-business"><strong>How
                                            Engineers Can Resolve Conflict and Save Their Business</strong></a></p>

                                <p>The system, essentially a tiny solar panel, is not likely to be powering our homes
                                    any time soon. But it&rsquo;s ripe for other applications. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
                                    started thinking more in terms in how do we use this for biomedical
                                    applications,&rdquo; Mannoor said. For instance, a bacteria and fungal device could
                                    be used to monitor the inside of the gut, to activate medication, or to modify
                                    dosage. But there&rsquo;s much work to be done before that could happen.</p><br>

                                <p>While Mannoor&rsquo;s mushroom was a proof of concept, it could be used today to give
                                    farmers an idea of the concentration of pesticides in their fields. &ldquo;There are
                                    some pesticides that interact with cyanobacteria cells, so this system in its
                                    current form is a pesticide sensor,&rdquo; he said.</p><br>

                                <p>A bacteria-coated mushroom could also be used to sense things humans might not want
                                    to get near.</p><br>

                                <p>&ldquo;Think of something like Ebola, where you don&rsquo;t want to be physically
                                    present to detect it,&rdquo; Mannoor said. &ldquo;We can have theses mushrooms
                                    growing in the field and, if you can augment the system with wireless, these
                                    mushrooms will be small hotspots of sensors, which can send off a signal to a nearby
                                    receiver, sensing the presence of viruses or other potential biohazards in the air.
                                    It&rsquo;s really totally autonomous.&rdquo;</p><br>

                                <p>But however promising these applications, Mannoor will leave their development to
                                    others. Getting the bacteria, the graphene, and the mushroom to work together is
                                    enough for him.<br />
                                    &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we are excited about, that we can actually interface and
                                    merge between the world of biology and the world of electronics, where in the final
                                    system we won&rsquo;t be able to tell where the biology ends and the electronic
                                    begins.&rdquo;</p><br>
