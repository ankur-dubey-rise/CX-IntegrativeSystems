<p>Mushrooms can delight the palate, be turned into packaging, and knock you dead. Now they have a new power&mdash;generate electricity by working as the substrate for a bacteria and graphene energy system. Call it the world&rsquo;s first bionic mushroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you go down on the size scale, both the biological and non-biological worlds have cool properties,&rdquo; said Manu Mannoor, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at the Stevens Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In particular, cyanobacteria are known for their ability to photosynthesize and graphene is known to conduct electricity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were looking for a way to somehow merge these two worlds and create something in the macroworld so we can access them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;To do that, they needed a mushroom.</p>

<p>When cyanobacteria photosynthesize there is a moment before the sun&rsquo;s energy is converted to sugars when electrons are produced. To access those electrons, Mannoor and his team planned to lay a grid of graphene nanoribbons across seams of the bacteria. To do so, though, they had to keep the bacteria alive. Previous researchers hoping to exploit cyanobacteria&rsquo;s energy conversion powers have had trouble doing that. In the natural world, cyanobacteria thrive in warm still waters. But on things like silicon, they perish. Manoor thought a mushroom might make a friendlier home for the bacteria.</p>

<p>They found that atop a specimen of <em>agaricus bisporus, </em>or the button mushroom, the bacteria stayed alive. Mannoor and his team were able to 3D print a spiral of densely packed cyanobacteria onto the head of the mushroom. A matrix of graphene nanoribbons&mdash;mixed with a conductive polymer to make a conductive 3D printable ink&mdash;were then printed over the bacteria. The ink, when it contacted the bacteria, sucked away electrons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;There are tiny things which are penetrating into the cells,&rdquo; Mannoor said. &ldquo;The electricity is collected and wired down through the stem of the mushroom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The system, essentially a tiny solar panel, is not likely to be powering our homes any time soon. But it&rsquo;s ripe for other applications. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve started thinking more in terms in how do we use this for biomedical applications,&rdquo; Mannoor said. For instance, a bacteria and fungal device could be used to monitor the inside of the gut, to activate medication, or to modify dosage. But there&rsquo;s much work to be done before that could happen.</p>

<p>While Mannoor&rsquo;s mushroom was a proof of concept, it could be used today to give farmers an idea of the concentration of pesticides in their fields. &ldquo;There are some pesticides that interact with cyanobacteria cells, so this system in its current form is a pesticide sensor,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>A bacteria-coated mushroom could also be used to sense things humans might not want to get near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of something like Ebola, where you don&rsquo;t want to be physically present to detect it,&rdquo; Mannoor said. &ldquo;We can have theses mushrooms growing in the field and, if you can augment the system with wireless, these mushrooms will be small hotspots of sensors, which can send off a signal to a nearby receiver, sensing the presence of viruses or other potential biohazards in the air. It&rsquo;s really totally autonomous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But however promising these applications, Mannoor will leave their development to others. Getting the bacteria, the graphene, and the mushroom to work together is enough for him.<br />
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we are excited about, that we can actually interface and merge between the world of biology and the world of electronics, where in the final system we won&rsquo;t be able to tell where the biology ends and the electronic begins.&rdquo;</p>
