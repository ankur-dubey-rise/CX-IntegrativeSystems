                <p>A more stable, accurate and powerful gyroscope &ndash; no larger than a grain of rice &ndash;
                    could soon make its way into wearable devices, nano platforms, and other applications.</p>
                <p>Gyroscopes enable vehicles, aircraft, robots, wearable, and other electronic devices to
                    determine location in three-dimensional space. In most cases, the data is generated by
                    microelectromechanical sensors (MEMS) that measure differences in the forces that act on
                    oscillating masses moving in opposite directions. But those gyroscopes have several
                    limitations, including their sensitivity to such factors as vibration and temperature.</p><br>

                <p>To counter this, optical gyroscopes were developed and made with no moving parts. Most of
                    them are smaller and more accurate than MEMS gyroscopes, making them good candidates for
                    miniaturization and nanophotonic platforms. But even the smallest high-performance optical
                    gyroscopes available today are too large for many portable applications. Another drawback is
                    their signal-to-noise ratio, which is generally limited by thermal fluctuations, component
                    drift, and fabrication mismatch. Due to those drawbacks and others, integrated nanophotonic
                    optical gyroscopes have yet to be developed. That could change.</p>

                <p>
                    The company built such a house on a &quot;shake table&quot; and equipped it with a few
                    inhabitants, some furniture, and a couple of glasses of wine. When the mock tremors hit,
                    in front of a rapt, hardhat-outfitted audience, the denizens hardly noticed, and not a
                    drop of wine was spilled. The system will be added to new, otherwise typically built
                    homes of an appropriate weight, and can be retrofitted to existing structures as well.
                </p>
                <p>Researchers at the California Institute of Technology have taken a big step toward making
                    those tiny gyroscopes a reality. Led by&nbsp;electrical and medical engineering professor
                    Ali Hajimiri, the team developed a proof-of-concept optical gyroscope that is 500 times
                    smaller than current state-of-the-art devices, or about the size of a grain of rice. It is
                    also vastly superior in precision, being able to detect &ldquo;phase shifts&rdquo; that are
                    30 times smaller than what current systems can detect, enhancing its performance by one to
                    two orders of magnitude.</p>

                <p>Optical gyroscopes measure the rate of rotation by detecting differences in two paths of
                    light&mdash;a phenomenon known as the Sagnac effect. A beam of light is split into twin
                    beams which travel in opposite directions along a circular pathway and meet at the same
                    light detector. Because light travels at a constant speed, rotation causes one of the beams
                    to arrive at the detector before the other. This phase shift is then used to calculate
                    orientation.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Hajimiri&rsquo;s all-integrated, nanophotonic optical gyroscope achieves its improvements
                    through &quot;reciprocal sensitivity enhancement.&quot; In this technique, reciprocal means
                    that both beams of light are affected the same way. In Hajimiri&rsquo;s gyroscope, light
                    moves through miniaturized optical waveguides, which are small conduits &ndash;about 200
                    nanometers tall, or about three times the width of a human hair - that carry light, acting
                    in the same way as wires that carry electricity. Imperfections in the optical path that
                    could affect the light beams - such as thermal fluctuations, light scattering, and other
                    interference &ndash; affect both beams in the same way.</p>

                <p>Hajimiri&#39;s team found a way to extract reciprocal noise while leaving signals from the
                    Sagnac effect in place. That enhances the gyroscope&rsquo;s reciprocal sensitivity, which
                    improves the signal-to-noise ratio. Those improvements enable the integration of the
                    gyroscope onto such a small chip.</p>

                <p>The lab built the system using silicon nanophotonics, &ldquo;which is an ideal platform for
                    implementing optical gyroscopes on the microscale due to its reliability and compatibility
                    with current mass production techniques,&rdquo; Hajimiri said. It also provides the
                    capability of integrating nanophotonic and electrical components onto a single substrate,
                    which helps with commercialization and controlling costs.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The optical gyroscope has no moving parts, making it an extremely robust system. System
                    dimensions are 2 by 1 by 2 millimeters. The build process deploys lithography to stack and
                    pattern several ultra-thin layers of silicon and silicon-dioxide.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;The only thing that moves inside the gyroscope are photons that travel at the speed of
                    light in a pair of very small loops hundreds of billions of times every second,&rdquo;
                    Hajimiri said. &ldquo;Extremely small changes in path length due to rotation can be
                    measured.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>The greatest challenge in designing the system was accurate detection of variations in the
                    optical path due to rotation, while minimizing sensitivity to thermal fluctuations and
                    drifts.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We did this by employing a technique we refer to as reciprocal sensitivity
                    enhancement, where the light travels in two opposite orientations [clockwise and
                    counterclockwise] in two loops for half of the cycle, and then travels in the opposite
                    direction for the other half,&rdquo; Hajimiri said. &ldquo;This way the effect of
                    non-idealities in the system can be cancelled, while the signal is amplified.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Tests show theproof-of-concept device is capable of detecting phase shifts 30 times smaller
                    than state of-the-art miniature fiber-optic gyroscopes, despite being 500 times smaller in
                    size. &ldquo;Thus, our approach is capable of enhancing the performance of optical
                    gyroscopes by one to two orders of magnitude,&rdquo; Hajimiri said.</p>

                <p>The team is already working to develop the next-generation of its current prototype.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;The level of interest we have received so far is very high,&rdquo; Hajimiri said.
                    &ldquo;Many parties have shown interest in working with us toward further development of
                    this technology.&rdquo;</p>
