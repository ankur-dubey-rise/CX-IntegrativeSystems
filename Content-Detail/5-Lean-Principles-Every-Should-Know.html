                        <p>Unless an engineer is directly involved in manufacturing, he or she may only be
                            slightly familiar with &ldquo;lean&rdquo; principles. Long considered a way to
                            greatly improve manufacturing efficiency, lean can be applied to any business or
                            production process, in any industry. For example, lean is now being used extensively
                            in the healthcare industry to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The principles
                            can even be used, on a smaller scale, to organize your office, workspace, or
                            laboratory.<br />

                                    Lean Principles for an Industry 4.0 World</a></strong></p>

                        <p>Lean was originally created by Toyota to eliminate waste and inefficiency in its
                            manufacturing operations. The process became so successful that it has been embraced
                            in manufacturing sectors around the world. For an American company, being lean is
                            critical for competing against lower-cost countries.</p>

                        <p>The goal of lean is to eliminate waste&mdash;the non-value-added components in any
                            process. Unless a process has gone through lean multiple times, it contains some
                            element of waste. When done correctly, lean can create huge improvements in
                            efficiency, cycle time, productivity, material costs, and scrap, leading to lower
                            costs and improved competitiveness. And remember, lean isn&rsquo;t restricted to
                            manufacturing. It can improve how a team works together, inventory management, and
                            even client interaction. &nbsp;</p>

                        <h3>Five Key Principles</h3>

                        <p>The <a href="http://www.lean.org" target="_blank">Lean Enterprise Institute</a>
                            (LEI), founded by James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones in 1997, is considered the
                            go-to resource for lean wisdom, training, and seminars. According to Womack and
                            Jones, there are five key lean principles: value, value stream, flow, pull, and
                            perfection.<br />
                            <br />
                            <a
                                href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/manufacturing-design/manufacturing-takes-flight"><b>Lessons
                                    in New Manufacturing: Pratt &amp; Whitney Takes Flight</b></a><br />
                            &nbsp;</p>

                        <p>1. Value. Value is always defined by the customer&rsquo;s needs for a specific
                            product. For example, what is the timeline for manufacturing and delivery? What is
                            the price point? What are other important requirements or expectations that must be
                            met? This information is vital for defining value.</p>

                        <p>2. Value stream. Once the value (end goal) has been determined, the next step is
                            mapping the &ldquo;value stream,&rdquo; or all the steps and processes involved in
                            taking a specific product from raw materials and delivering the final product to the
                            customer. Value-stream mapping is a simple but eye-opening experience that
                            identifies all the actions that take a product or service through any process. That
                            process can be in design, production, procurement, HR, administration, delivery, or
                            customer service. The idea is to draw, on one page, a &quot;map&quot; of the flow of
                            material/product through the process. The goal is to identify every step that does
                            not create value and then find ways to eliminate those wasteful steps. Value-stream
                            mapping is sometimes referred to as process re-engineering. Ultimately this exercise
                            also results in a better understanding of the entire business operation.<br />

                            <br />
                            3. Flow. After the waste has been removed from the value stream, the next step is to
                            be sure the remaining steps flow smoothly with no interruptions, delays, or
                            bottlenecks. &ldquo;Make the value-creating steps occur in tight sequence so that
                            the product or service will flow smoothly toward the customer,&rdquo; advises LEI.
                            This may require breaking down silo thinking and making the effort to become
                            cross-functional across all departments, which can be one of the greatest challenges
                            for lean programs to overcome. However, studies show that this will also lead to
                            huge gains in productivity and efficiency, sometimes as high as 50-percent
                            improvement or more.</p>

                        <p>4. Pull. With improved flow, time to market (or time to customer) can be dramatically
                            improved. This makes it much easier to deliver products as needed, as in &ldquo;just
                            in time&rdquo; manufacturing or delivery. This means the customer can
                            &ldquo;pull&rdquo; the product from you as needed (often in weeks, instead of
                            months). As a result, products don&rsquo;t need to be built in advance or materials
                            stockpiled, creating expensive inventory that needs to be managed, saving money for
                            both the manufacturer/provider and the customer.</p>

                        <p>5. Perfection. Accomplishing Steps 1-4 is a great start, but the fifth step is
                            perhaps the most important: making lean thinking and process improvement part of
                            your corporate culture. As gains continue to pile up, it is important to remember
                            lean is not a static system and requires constant effort and vigilance to perfect.
                            Every employee should be involved in implementing lean. Lean experts often say that
                            a process is not truly lean until it has been through value-stream mapping at least
                            half a dozen times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>Making It Last</strong></p>

                        <p>Lean can be infectious. Customers will notice big improvements as you implement lean
                            and likely want to be part of your process. This collaborative thinking will also
                            extend to your suppliers as well, who will want to use lean themselves to generate
                            their own improvements. &nbsp;</p>

                        <p>The core idea behind lean is maximizing&nbsp;customer value&nbsp;while minimizing
                            waste,&rdquo; states LEI. &ldquo;Simply put, lean means creating more value for
                            customers with fewer resources.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>A lean organization understands customer value and focuses its key processes to
                            continuously increase it. The ultimate goal is to provide perfect value to the
                            customer through a perfect value creation process that has zero waste. &ldquo;Lean
                            accomplishes this,&rdquo; adds LEI, &ldquo;by changing the focus of management from
                            optimizing separate technologies, assets, and vertical departments to optimizing the
                            flow of products and services through entire value streams that flow horizontally
                            across technologies, assets, and departments to customers.&rdquo;</p>
