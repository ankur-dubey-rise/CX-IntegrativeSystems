                        <p>Whether you are presenting to a small group of 20 or a large group of 200, there are many
                            things you can to do in advance to ensure that your presentation achieves the desired
                            response. The most important is to know and understand your audience as well as the venue
                            logistics.</p>

                        <p>To connect with your audience, you need to understand why your topic is important to them.
                            What do they expect to learn from the presentation? Don&#39;t assume the audience is like
                            you. They may have cultural or geographic biases and the more you understand them, the
                            better you can express yourself to them and avoid speaking gaffes. It is also important to
                            know the level of knowledge they have about your topic, so you can present the information
                            with the correct tone to keep people interested and engaged. There is nothing more insulting
                            than to present basic information to a highly knowledgeable audience, and conversely, speak
                            at too high a level for a novice audience.<br />

                        <p>If you are presenting in a foreign country, it is important to understand the cultural
                            differences of the audience. How do they dress? How is their sense of humor? How do they
                            typically communicate? What gestures are appropriate or inappropriate? Are there religious
                            factors that should be considered?</p>

                        <p>There are several things you can do to prepare and research your audience before and at the
                            beginning of the talk that will help you adjust your speech to better engage the audience.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="big">Research in Advance</h2>

                        <p>Prior to the meeting or event, speak to the organizer or sponsor of the meeting and find out
                            the level of knowledge the audience has on the topic for discussion. Ask about the audience
                            expectations as well as their demographics&ndash;age, background, gender, etc. If you are
                            presenting at an industry event, research the event Web site and familiarize yourself with
                            the mission of the event and typical attendees.</p>

                        <p>If you are presenting to a corporation, then learn as much as you can about them by visiting
                            their Web site, reading news reports, and reviewing their blogs.</p>

                        <h2 class="big">Greet Them at the Door</h2>

                        <p>If you are unable to find out much information about the audience prior to the meeting,
                            you&#39;ll have to improvise and adjust your talk on the fly based on information you
                            collect at the beginning of the meeting.</p>

                        <p><a alt="Toastmasters International" href="http://www.toastmasters.org/"
                                title="Toastmasters International">Toastmasters International</a>, a nonprofit
                            educational organization that teaches public speaking and leadership skills, suggests that,
                            if possible, the speaker greet people at the door and ask questions to ascertain their level
                            of knowledge and expectations of the audience. You&#39;ll also make a few friends in the
                            beginning and it&#39;s always nice to have friends in the room.</p>

                        <h2 class="big">Call and Response Technique</h2>

                        <p>Toastmasters also suggests that speakers use the &quot;Call and Response&quot; technique at
                            the beginning of the talk. Frame questions at the beginning geared toward learning about the
                            audience. Find out how much experience they have with the topic and adjust the speech
                            accordingly. Using this method you can also gauge the mood of the audience. If the audience
                            seems to be in a lighthearted mood, the speaker can use humor to keep audience interest. If
                            they seem to be serious or the topic is of a serious nature, then the speaker should get
                            right to meat of the talk.</p>

                        <h2 class="big">Be Familiar with the Room Layout</h2>

                        <p>Public speaking coach <a alt="Lisa Braithwaite"
                                href="http://www.businessknowhow.com/growth/speaking-audience.htm"
                                title="Lisa Braithwaite">Lisa Braithwaite</a> suggests that the speaker visit the
                            location of the talk prior to the meeting if possible to see how the room will be laid out,
                            and to make any requests for positioning the visual aid equipment. Braithwaite also notes
                            that knowing more about the venue and the size of the room will give the speaker some idea
                            as to how energetic and physical they will have to be to engage the audience, whether a
                            microphone will needed, and what type of visual aids will be the most effective.</p>

                        <p>When you know more about your audience and their expectations, you&#39;ll be able to tailor
                            your talk to make it more interesting. Your audience will be engaged and satisfied, and you
                            will willingly accept their applause at the end.</p>
