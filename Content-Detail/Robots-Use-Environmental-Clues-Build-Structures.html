                                <p>Beavers are widely known for their engineering ingenuity in building dams and
                                    water-protected lodges. Now researchers at the University at Buffalo have built a
                                    robot that <a

                                        the way</a> beavers draw cues from the surrounding environment to build
                                    structures.</p><br>

                                <p>The idea is to make robots that can build on-the-fly structures by understanding
                                    undefined environments, as opposed to <a

                                        structures</a> based on pre-defined plans. With the help of an algorithm and
                                    sensory input, the robot determines the kind of structure to make and the best way
                                    to construct it.</p><br>

                                <p>The ability to adapt flexibly to challenging environments is important for robots
                                    that are intended to work in the field, such as helping rescuers in disaster areas.
                                    The robot built by Napp&rsquo;s team has an external 3-D camera to evaluate
                                    surroundings, map the terrain, and collect metrics like height of an object.</p><br>

                                <p>It also has an arm to pick up and deposit items. &ldquo;Future versions of the robot
                                    will have all the sensors on board,&rdquo; Napp said.</p><br>

                                <p>The researchers used debris from an earthquake testing facility and natural rocks in
                                    test scenarios for the robot.</p><br>

                                <p>The robot does not work with actual rocks and real-world clutter, but the goal is to
                                    get a degree of understanding on how the robot would scale to a human-sized system.
                                </p><br>

                                <p>&ldquo;The building material is compliant bags,&rdquo; Napp said. &ldquo;We use them
                                    because they conform to the environment so we can use them over pretty cluttered
                                    areas.&rdquo;</p><br>

                                <p>The ultimate goal is to develop teams of robots that can work together autonomously
                                    and interact with the environment in real time to build structures in places that
                                    are otherwise inaccessible to human workers. </p>
