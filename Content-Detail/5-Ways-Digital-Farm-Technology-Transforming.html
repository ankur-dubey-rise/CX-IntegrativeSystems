                <p>Old McDonald&rsquo;s farm, like many things in our high-tech age, has gotten a lot
                    smarter.</p>

                <p>As crop information is increasingly tracked, digitized, and synced with other
                    variables like soil composition and weather forecasts, <a

                        equipment and processes</a> are becoming more agile. Commonly called precision
                    agriculture, new technologies that harness the power of data are revolutionizing how
                    agriculture is managed and how food flows through the supply chain to your table.
                    &nbsp;</p>

                <p>Here are five ways that modern agriculture is embracing digital disruption and how
                    these tools are changing the industry.</p>

                <h3>Seed Location Via GPS</h3>

                <p>A farmer&rsquo;s ability to know the precise location where seeds are planted is
                    incredibly valuable; it allows them to come back to that same seed with the
                    appropriate amount of water and fertilizer at the various stages of its development.
                </p>

                <p>&ldquo;Imagine you put a penny in the middle of your driveway and you wanted to <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/robotics/gps-helps-robots-get-job-done">use
                        a GPS monitor</a> to find it;&nbsp;you couldn&rsquo;t with uncorrected GPS. To
                    have that level of accuracy, you have to use ancillary paid correction
                    signal,&rdquo; said Chad Pfitzer of Trimble Advanced Positioning, which provides a
                    corrected signal (as do companies like John Deere and New Holland). &ldquo;GPS,
                    which gives you the ability to position seeds more effectively and mark their
                    precise location, is a pillar of precision farming.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>At its outset in the late 2000s, GPS was applied to farm equipment with aftermarket
                    products. It was pretty much like buying a navigation system for your dashboard
                    versus having a navigation system integrated into your car.</p>

                <p>This equipment and GPS-enabled functionality has becoming increasingly integrated by
                    the industry. Today, the precision possible through GPS mapping is making farmers
                    more knowledgeable than ever about their crops, which is helping them to
                    strategically manage more acreage and grow more crops.</p>

                <h3>Data-driven Guidance</h3>

                <p>When automated guidance steers a tractor &ndash; no hands required&mdash; along a row
                    to plant seeds and fertilize them, it can create and manage fields with incredible
                    accuracy. Far more accurate, in fact, than when humans do the job.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s expensive to farm,&rdquo; Pfitzer said. &ldquo;One 50-pound bag of
                    seed might cost $500 and only cover one or two rows. Now, imagine a seed in a row
                    like a penny in the driveway. GPS allows farmers to mark the placement of the seed
                    with incredible accuracy, come back to it with fertilizer, and carefully track its
                    yield as needed.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Guidance, <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/manufacturing-design/making-sense-realtime-factory-data">driven
                        by big data</a> analytics, is also a great physical help for the farmer.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Driving the tractor for row after row over ten thousand acres with one or two
                    people is like driving from Denver to Des Moines in one day,&rdquo; Pfitzer said.
                    &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exhausting. Guidance allows the farmer to have free hands, to use
                    their time in the tractor focused on farm management, or to read a book if they
                    like.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>That totally changes the physical aspects of the job, transitioning farming from a
                    task that involves driving heavy equipment all day to one that allows farmers to
                    spend more time focused on high-level management.</p>

                <h3>Smart Irrigation</h3>

                <p>Imagine a center pivot irrigation system &ndash; those large watering sprinklers that
                    move in circles over fields &ndash; that knows exactly how fast to move and where
                    water is most needed at any given moment.</p>

                <p>It sounds like science fiction, but it&rsquo;s actually in service now thanks to
                    Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) technology. VRI systems gather field data including
                    crop type, development stage of the crop, soil type, grade of the land, and weather
                    information, and use that information to distribute water as effectively as
                    possible. This allows farms to control water distribution by zone, speed, and
                    individual sprinkler at each degree of the 360 degree circle, which prevents
                    watering areas that don&rsquo;t need it.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;If you are going to get six inches of rain tomorrow, the center pivot will
                    know not to irrigate,&rdquo; said Andrew Oerman, with Valley Irrigation, one company
                    that&rsquo;s working on VRI systems.</p>

                <p>It is almost like another set of eyes in the field, automatically maintaining soil
                    moisture, especially with critical crops.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;It gives us the opportunity to make some educated, quick decisions as to
                    whether we need to turn on or shut off and what it looks like forecasted out four or
                    five days, so we can actually make some good irrigation management decisions,&rdquo;
                    said Greg Juul of G2 Farming in Hermiston, Ore. &nbsp;</p>

                <h3>Digital Pasture Management</h3>

                <p>By using GPS enabled ear tags, ranchers can better manage their pastures, move
                    livestock strategically for rotational grazing, and quickly troubleshoot issues.</p>

                <p>While cattle tagging has long been industry standard, electronic tags are more
                    convenient and make it easier to identify and manage animals remotely. The rancher
                    just has to scan the tag with a reader and their phone will light up with all the
                    details they need about that particular animal. That&rsquo;s a lot easier than
                    reading a visual tag or tattoo number.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;As cattle are being worked or loaded into a trailer, their EID tag can be
                    scanned while they are in the chute or loading alley,&rdquo; said Kristen Evans of
                    <a
                        href="https://www.cattletags.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwpeXeBRA6EiwAyoJPKryYFSBf8NvR1U6CJn_dy0nhcj30azogHZ7Q9UH8tfseKbA07t5Q9RoC4JkQAvD_BwE">Cattle
                        Tags</a>. Think of it as the &ldquo;FedEx&rdquo; style tracking of large
                    animals.</p>

                <p>Currently, only about 5 percent of cattle have electronic tags, as there are no
                    mandatory tagging requirements. But that&rsquo;s changing as the industry moves to
                    address supply chain risks and food contamination.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;The trouble is that when there&rsquo;s an outbreak of <em>e. coli</em>, for
                    example, it can easily be traced to the producer (the meat plant), but not the
                    source (the exact farm),&rdquo; said Jim Matheson, assistant director of the
                    American Bison Association. &ldquo;If an animal is tagged, you should be able to
                    track a piece of meat that you buy at a store back to the animal of origin.&rdquo;
                </p>

                <h3>Blockchain and Farm to Table</h3>

                <p><a href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/manufacturing-processing/the-chain-gang">A
                        blockchain ledger</a> is a unique code that carefully tracks goods through all
                    parts of the transaction.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say you have a small coffee shop that wants to know where the
                    coffee they are purchasing came from to verify that it&rsquo;s fair trade,&rdquo;
                    said Shalom Ben Or of <a href="https://www.avenews-gt.com/">Avenews-GT</a>, which
                    provides a digital trading platform for verified agri-businesses, farm and other ag
                    transactions. &ldquo;The digital platform easily allows the seller to give a
                    guarantee that coffee is being sold, how much was paid, quality, etc.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>By providing a trusted, universal proof of ownership, blockchain technology is also
                    helping to expedite purchases of food and other products, minimize risk to buyers,
                    and protect consumers.</p>

                <p>These days, fitness trackers have invited a tech into everyday life, collecting
                    details on sleep patterns, steps, heart rate, etc. with the goal of improving health
                    and wellness.</p>

                <p>This functionality is also at work on the modern farm. Except there the&nbsp;details
                    are being tracked, analyzed, and applied to make agriculture more productive. Once
                    the goods leave the farm or the ranch, their trail is&nbsp;tracked to the retailer,
                    which makes the consumer smarter.</p>

                <p>All of this new technology is helping one of the oldest industries on the planet
                    scale up to meet the demands of a growing world.</p>
