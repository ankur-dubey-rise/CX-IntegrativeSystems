                            <p class="mt-2">It&rsquo;s no secret that opioid drug abuse is one of the great scourges of
                                our time.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2">Every day in the U.S. more than 115 people die after overdosing on opioid
                                pain relievers, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the issue
                                has a total economic burden, including the costs of healthcare, treatment, criminal
                                justice activity and lost productivity, of more than $78 billion per year.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2">And the problem is just getting worse.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2">Opioid-related overdoses jumped 30 percent between July 2016 and September
                                2017, led by the Midwest, where such overdoses increased by 70 percent. Research has
                                shown that about 25 percent of patients who are prescribed opioids for <a

                                    pain</a> misuse them at some point, and about 10 percent of those end up becoming
                                addicted.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2">That&rsquo;s the bad news. The good news is that medical researchers are
                                already working on a variety of new treatments to <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/career-education/articles/undergraduate-students/shutting-door-on-prescription-addiction">lessen
                                    dependence</a> on opioid painkillers and prevent these overdoses. Some of the most
                                promising of these treatments are coming out of bioengineering departments. Those
                                treatments involve neurostimulation, the delivery of high-frequency stimulation to
                                sensory nerves in the peripheral nervous system to block pain signals. One such system,
                                known as kilohertz frequency alternative current block, was developed by Kevin Kilgore
                                and Niloy Bhadra, doctors at Case Western Reserve&rsquo;s Department of Biomedical
                                Engineering and MetroHealth Medical Center, building on earlier efforts that date back
                                to the 1980s.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2">&ldquo;Though there had been some work done, it had been completely
                                neglected, so we started doing pretty intensive pre-clinical animal studies and outlined
                                a lot of the basic parameters,&rdquo; Bhadra says.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2">Although previous high-frequency systems showed results at lower
                                frequencies, the Case Western team found the best <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/delivering-drugs-providing-relief">pain
                                    relieving</a> returns at a range between roughly 10 and 30 kilohertz. Their
                                innovation was creating a neurostimulation technology that is stable and reliable enough
                                for medical use. When used in medical devices, this technology can turn nerve responses
                                on and off at will, with pain relieving effects that linger well after treatment ends.
                            </p>

                            <p class="mt-2">&ldquo;The nerve conducts signals by sodium and potassium channels,&rdquo;
                                Bhadra says. &ldquo;What is amazing is that when you apply high frequency to a
                                peripheral nerve, it can actually put the sodium channel into a state where it cannot
                                function anymore. That block can start within less than a second, and then when you turn
                                it off, recovery happens in a few seconds, which is completely different from any other
                                nerve block mortality that&#39;s known.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p class="mt-2">This type of technology could serve in a wide variety of applications.</p>
