                <p>It&rsquo;s no secret that opioid drug abuse is one of the great scourges of
                    our time.</p>

                <p>Every day in the U.S. more than 115 people die after overdosing on opioid
                    pain relievers, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the issue
                    has a total economic burden, including the costs of healthcare, treatment, criminal
                    justice activity and lost productivity, of more than $78 billion per year.</p>

                <p>And the problem is just getting worse.</p>

                <p>Opioid-related overdoses jumped 30 percent between July 2016 and September
                    2017, led by the Midwest, where such overdoses increased by 70 percent. Research has
                    shown that about 25 percent of patients who are prescribed opioids for <a

                        pain</a> misuse them at some point, and about 10 percent of those end up becoming
                    addicted.</p>

                <p>That&rsquo;s the bad news. The good news is that medical researchers are
                    already working on a variety of new treatments to <a

                        dependence</a> on opioid painkillers and prevent these overdoses. Some of the most
                    promising of these treatments are coming out of bioengineering departments. Those
                    treatments involve neurostimulation, the delivery of high-frequency stimulation to
                    sensory nerves in the peripheral nervous system to block pain signals. One such system,
                    known as kilohertz frequency alternative current block, was developed by Kevin Kilgore
                    and Niloy Bhadra, doctors at Case Western Reserve&rsquo;s Department of Biomedical
                    Engineering and MetroHealth Medical Center, building on earlier efforts that date back
                    to the 1980s.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Though there had been some work done, it had been completely
                    neglected, so we started doing pretty intensive pre-clinical animal studies and outlined
                    a lot of the basic parameters,&rdquo; Bhadra says.</p>

                <p>Although previous high-frequency systems showed results at lower
                    frequencies, the Case Western team found the best <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/delivering-drugs-providing-relief">pain
                        relieving</a> returns at a range between roughly 10 and 30 kilohertz. Their
                    innovation was creating a neurostimulation technology that is stable and reliable enough
                    for medical use. When used in medical devices, this technology can turn nerve responses
                    on and off at will, with pain relieving effects that linger well after treatment ends.
                </p>

                <p>&ldquo;The nerve conducts signals by sodium and potassium channels,&rdquo;
                    Bhadra says. &ldquo;What is amazing is that when you apply high frequency to a
                    peripheral nerve, it can actually put the sodium channel into a state where it cannot
                    function anymore. That block can start within less than a second, and then when you turn
                    it off, recovery happens in a few seconds, which is completely different from any other
                    nerve block mortality that&#39;s known.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>This type of technology could serve in a wide variety of applications.</p>
