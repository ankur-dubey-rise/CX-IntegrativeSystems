                        <p>Many areas of the US and the world in general have experienced periods of hotter-than-usual
                            weather recently, but how those changes will affect the electricity grid within urban areas
                            hasn&rsquo;t really been studied.</p>

                        <p>Until now.</p>

                        <p>As it stands, urban <a

                                title="An Energy Grid with a Mind of Its Own">energy grids</a> face significant
                            challenges and uncertainties, including the increased frequency and intensity of heat waves
                            and droughts, says Kristen Cetin, an assistant professor of construction engineering at Iowa
                            State University. No one wants another blackout, much less the specter of commonplace
                            blackouts as grids become overloaded in hot weather.</p>

                        <p>To help cities prepare for increased demand on the electric grid, researchers at two
                            universities recently began collecting and consolidating electricity-use data from areas
                            close to their homes, Cetin says. She&rsquo;s the principal investigator on the project.</p>

                        <p>In August, researchers at both Iowa State and the University of Texas-Austin began sampling
                            <a href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/design/aerospace-bets-on-big-data"
                                title="Aerospace Bets on Big Data">consumer data</a> from municipalities in Des Moines,
                            IA, and Austin, TX.</p>

                        <p>The researchers&rsquo; models bring together disparate sources, including historical
                            observations. Cetin and her fellow researchers have collected about 60 years of historical
                            weather data for the areas studied as well as current global and regional climate models.

                        <p>Synthesizing the data should help them understand what the weather will be like in these
                            locations in the future.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;You can look at different <a

                            have been developed and understand what weather would be like for different
                            locations,&rdquo; Cetin says.</p>

                        <p>Then, they&rsquo;ll produce climate models of extreme conditions those areas could face, she
                            says. The models will depict how an area&rsquo;s power plants will be affected by weather in
                            the future.</p>

                        <p>While climate models exist on a national and global scale, few climate models have been
                            created for smaller, more specific areas such as cities. But cities experience unique
                            climate anomalies. Urban heat islands&mdash;large, paved areas&mdash;demonstrate how parts
                            of a city can experience vastly different temperatures, Cetin says.</p>

                        <p>The models the researchers will build with the information they&rsquo;ve collected can give a
                            city&rsquo;s <a

                            they need to make plans for their grids, she adds.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;A challenge that cities face when you have these extreme weather events is trying to
                            maintain reliability of the electric grid,&rdquo; Cetin says. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got
                            uncertainties associated with certain scenarios, there&rsquo;s a higher risk of there being
                            an issue with your grid.</p>

                        <p>Utilities must balance electricity production and consumption at all times, she says. And for
                            that, they need to be prepared for how to respond to times of peak use. &ldquo;If you have
                            higher energy consumption and lower production that&rsquo;s where there&rsquo;s an
                            issue,&rdquo; she adds. The team&rsquo;s findings and the models they create could
                            significantly impact the way cities and electric utility operators manage electric grids in

                                heat</a> and drought, Cetin says.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;Utility companies could use the models as an assessment tool to look at the issues
                            they anticipate happening and what they need to plan for,&rdquo; she adds.</p>

                        <p>Today&rsquo;s electrical providers use a system called demand response that adjusts the
                            demand for power rather than the power supply. One of the demand-response techniques
                            involves building owners allowing the electric company to remotely operate thermostats in
                            return for reduced energy costs. During times of <a
                                href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/making-the-grid-really-smart"
                                title="Making the Grid Really Smart">peak energy</a> use, utilities can remotely turn up
                            the thermostat for a certain amount of time.</p>

                        <p>After the researchers&rsquo; city models are complete, a second stage of the project will
                            allow utilities to simulate different demand response scenarios in response to climate
                            forecasts, Cetin says. The utilities can then choose ahead of time how to respond to peak
                            energy use, and to heat that could last for longer periods of time than it does now.</p>

                        <p>Utilities may look at raising rates during peak times to discourage energy use, for example.
                        </p>

                        <p>&ldquo;Or maybe they&rsquo;d look at energy storage, where they store some of the energy
                            prior to peak time and use it to cool the building where they want to consume less
                            electricity form the grid,&rdquo; she adds.</p>

                        <p>While the project starts with Des Moines and Ames, Cetin hopes models like these will be
                            created for other cities across the United States, Cetin adds.</p>

                        <p>And because Cetin&rsquo;s work in general focuses on building and construction, she&rsquo;s
                            thought about how the models will impact building owners as well as utility operators.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;Maybe if a utility company was going to raise rates during peak-use times, that would
                            change how a building owner would operate their building,&rdquo; Cetin says.</p>

                        <p>Utilities can&rsquo;t shy away from the problem of prolonged periods of heat. It needs to be
                            addressed head on. And simulation and modeling gives energy companies a tool to do just
                            that.</p>
