                <p>Ingenuity and vision are the hallmarks of great engineering. Envisioning the machines of
                    tomorrow is especially important, and some technologies &ndash; visible and invisible
                    &ndash; could change the way we design and make products.</p>

                <p>New communication technologies will link up machines much like cellular technologies
                    interconnecting humans. These technologies could make it common for hospitals to <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/top-5-advances-medical-technology">monitor
                        patients</a> as soon as they are in an ambulance, or for factories to be alerted to
                    hazardous conditions by remote industrial control rooms.</p>

                <p>One of these critical technologies is 5G, which had a coming out party at the recent
                    Mobile World Congress (MWC) trade show held in Barcelona. The show is largely a showcase
                    for the newest mobile handsets, but the latest Internet of Things technologies also took
                    the spotlight. We explore the ten top trends from the show.</p>

                <p>1) Goodbye, 4G. 5G is the faster successor to 4G, and it is coming soon. By the end of
                    2018, AT&amp;T will launch its 5G network for mobile devices, and soon after, it will be
                    in machines, cars, <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/technology-and-society/filling-the-talent-gap"
                        title="filling the talent gap">IoT devices</a>, drones, and infrastructure
                    equipment. Simply explained, 5G will allow machines to make long-distance data calls to
                    other mechanical and electrical devices at speeds faster than today&rsquo;s home
                    internet connections. 5G modems were shown by Intel, Qualcomm, and Sierra Wireless,
                    while Ericsson talked about 5G technologies for IoT devices and machines. Ubimetro
                    boasted about a 5G connected street lamp, while Germany&rsquo;s Fraunhofer Institute
                    demonstrated a 5G security camera with superfast connection to a computer so it could
                    instantly recognize a face.</p>

                    <strong>Also for You: The <a

                            Technology Award</a> in Manufacturing.</strong></p>

                <p>2) Blockchain. Many think blockchain is the same as bitcoin, but it isn&rsquo;t.
                    Blockchain is the underlying technology that makes bitcoin possible, and it can be
                    adapted to manufacturing. Companies like Cisco and Nokia are exploring ways to log
                    timestamped data sent from <a

                        title="making sense of sensors">sensors</a> on a digital ledger &ndash; which is at
                    the center of blockchain &ndash; and instantly verifying it as being genuine. A deeper
                    audit trail on a blockchain could help in the effective management of sensors and
                    machines.</p>

                <p>3) 5G Robot. NTT DoCoMo of Japan demonstrated a 5G humanoid robot &ldquo;that uses 5G to
                    mirror the operator&#39;s movements in real time and perform tasks remotely.&rdquo; The
                    idea was to demonstrate the speed of 5G and how it can mimic human movement almost
                    instantly. NTT also expects to put 5G IoT devices all over 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, so if
                    you plan to be there, watch out.</p>

                <p>4) Augmented Identity. The concept of &quot;augmented identity&quot; is key to preventing
                    future car theft. IDEMIA, a French company, wants to bring facial recognition for the
                    authorized use of cars. Enroll your face with a system, and a car will unlock only if it
                    recognizes your face. The technology uses sensors, location tracking, and software.
                    IDEMIA has a larger goal of enabling a more secure shared driving culture.</p>
