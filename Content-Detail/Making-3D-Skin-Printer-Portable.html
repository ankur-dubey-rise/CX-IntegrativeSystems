                            <p>In the medical industry, so-called &ldquo;deep wounds&rdquo; can be complicated in terms
                                of the cost to the patient and facility, as well as in terms of the size of the
                                equipment needed to treat them. But what if that equipment could be simplified to the
                                point that it could be held in the palm of a hand? A University of Toronto team is at
                                work on a handheld <a

                                    skin printer</a>, weighing less than a kilogram, that could provide a revolutionary
                                change to the field. &nbsp;</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;We had a student in 2012 who developed an approach to <a

                                    hydrogel sheets</a> using a microfluidic device,&rdquo; says Axel Guenther,
                                associate professor in the department of mechanical and industrial engineering at the
                                University of Toronto. &ldquo;They were free-flowing sheets we prepared with a
                                crystalline solution. Ultimately there was collaboration with a local burn surgeon and
                                we realized from research that we could stick skin cells onto sheets. We could prepare
                                them but transferring them onto a wound was quite challenging, particularly for the
                                larger substrates inherently relevant for burns.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p><strong>For You: <a

                            <p>He says a limitation of conventional printers is actually the fundamental process of
                                printing skin in of itself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s challenging when you have a large living
                                organism that&rsquo;s breathing [like skin],&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy
                                to make it work with an inherently moving object [like a printer].&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>The new process and printer the team has developed could lead to a better <a
                                    href="https://aabme.asme.org/posts/new-wound-care-product-offers-the-next-step-in-healing">wound
                                    healing process</a> than the typical grafting process used today, Guenther says,
                                adding that they came to the conclusion that forming the skin substitute right above the
                                wounds was the best approach, so that manual manipulation of the bio ink wouldn&rsquo;t
                                be necessary.</p>

                                        The skin printer resembles a tape dispenser, but the “tape” roll is a

                            <p>&ldquo;The technology we&rsquo;re using now is a duct tape dispenser where the tape is
                                not a pre-rolled type of synthetic tape but a tissue tape deposited right above a wound
                                band,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The handheld unit has onboard syringe pumps, and parts of
                                the printer are manufactured with sterilized plastics and surgical steel. And a stepper
                                motor drives the printer at a controlled speed. The consumable is the printer itself,
                                which is a microfluidic device.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>The portability of the printer means treating more patients in more places as well, with
                                minimal operator training required. The device also eliminates the washing and
                                incubation stages&nbsp;that must occur in many conventional bioprinters.</p>

                            <p>The bio ink, or &ldquo;skin,&rdquo; used by the printer contains collagen and fibrin
                                across the entire sheet, so the composition of that tissue within the layer that is
                                applied to the natural skin is controlled by the microscale channel architecture, he
                                says. The fibrin in the printed skin can also act as a strong catalyst in wound healing,
                                helping the printed skin adhere to the natural cells, effectively acting as a sealant,
                                he says.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;The bio ink is supplied by a polymer that contains cells,&rdquo; he says.
                                &ldquo;On contact with a crosslinker or upon experiencing a temperature change, the
                                biopolymer is converted into a gel and these are materials commonly used in medicine for
                                creating tissues.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>The speed at which the material is deposited has the printer moving at a rate of about
                                one&nbsp;centimeter per second. However, there is still work to be done on the bio ink.
                            </p>

                            <p>&ldquo;Skin is composite material, squishy, but it also has collagen in it,&rdquo; says
                                Guenther. &lsquo;It gives it structural integrity and that&rsquo;s something we
                                currently can&rsquo;t say we deliver. We are planning to have composite bio inks over
                                time that represent the full range of tensile properties.&rdquo;</p>
