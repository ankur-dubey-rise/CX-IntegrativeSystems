                <p>American industry&mdash;especially the energy industry&mdash; is stronger when it can draw
                    talent from all over.</p>

                <p>Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen: Those seven countries were singled out
                    when President Donald J. Trump issued a travel ban via executive order two Januaries ago.
                    The countries on the list were either wracked by war or long isolated by sanctions, so it
                    would be easy to believe that the ban would have only minor impact on American industry or
                    the nation as a whole.</p>

                <p>But travel restrictions don&rsquo;t only affect immigrants, asylum-seekers, and refugees.
                    They also impact world-class scientists <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/technology-and-society/designing-the-ethical-engineer">looking
                        to improve</a> the human condition. The movement of people is valuable to both
                    individuals and to the global economy. That&rsquo;s especially true for scientists and
                    researchers, whose endeavors usually depend on&mdash;or at the very least benefit
                    from&mdash;collaboration.</p>

                <p>On American university campuses, the travel ban was immediately felt. At the University of
                    Texas in Austin, where I&rsquo;m a faculty member, 110 students, scholars, and faculty were
                    affected. Students I know. This isn&rsquo;t some remote, abstract mystery to me. It&rsquo;s
                    real. The impact of that experience can be multiplied across hundreds of universities and
                    every state.</p>

                <p>In fact, scientists who work and live in Europe but who have also conducted research in the
                    targeted regions can no longer easily come to the U.S. to collaborate and share insights.
                    Instead of a quick entry into the country, some British researchers have reported
                    multi-month delays in obtaining entry visas.</p>

                <p>There are also slowdowns and reductions in issuances of H1B visas for skilled legal
                    immigrants, which is a negative hit for industry. For the tech sector and energy industry,
                    which are comprised of many global companies, these restrictions and travel bans are
                    problematic. It makes it harder for them to recruit from around the world or work seamlessly
                    within their multinational enterprises. It&rsquo;s possible that an Iraqi supervisor working
                    in the oil industry in Houston could oversee workers in Europe, but would not be able to
                    visit them in person because of the fear that he or she would not be allowed to return to
                    the U.S.</p>

                <p>Some people might shrug these off as problems only for foreigners and a potential boon for
                    native-born Americans, but we all benefit from international collaboration. In 2017, the
                    Economist magazine noted that all of the world&rsquo;s restrictions on the free movement of
                    human talent hacks $78 trillion off global GDP.</p>

                <p>The story of <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/making-nextgeneration-lithiumion-batteries-safer">the
                        lithium-ion battery</a> shows what is at stake if the exchange of scientific ideas is
                    disrupted. The Li-ion battery is ubiquitous, carried in our hands inside our smartphones and
                    laptop computers, and it promises to enable critical opportunities like electric vehicles
                    and <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/computing-power-sensors-strengthen-rural-electric">the
                        integration of wind and solar</a> into the electric grid. But this breakthrough would
                    not have happened without interactions between different scientists in different countries.
                    The early development of the Li-ion battery spanned from the 1960s through the 1980s and
                    included scientists who interacted and exchanged ideas in Europe, Japan, and the United
                    States working at companies like Ford, Asahi, Sony, and ExxonMobil, and at universities such
                    as MIT, Oxford, and the University of Texas at Austin.</p>

                <p>Had policies prevented collaboration between those countries in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, then
                    it is likely that the Li-ion battery would never have come to fruition&mdash;at least on its
                    present schedule or with its current excellent performance. Similarly, new gas turbines are
                    developed by international teams distributed across the globe, and the most advanced
                    offshore wind <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/introducing-worlds-most-powerful-tidal-turbine">turbines</a>
                    are built using European technology. Which world-changing technological breakthroughs of
                    tomorrow are we going to miss because of the travel restrictions today?</p>

                <p>Because universities are so severely impacted, it makes perfect sense that they were leading
                    the charge to reverse the ban. The lawsuit against the travel ban was led by the state of
                    Washington on behalf of its flagship university.</p>

                <p>Universities have been leading voices against the recent wave of travel restrictions, but
                    they should not be alone. It is in the interest of American industries&mdash; especially the
                    energy industry&mdash;that the most talented workers can come to the U.S. and promote
                    innovation here.</p>
