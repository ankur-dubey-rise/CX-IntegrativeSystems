                <p>Engineers excel at solving problems, but developing soft skills to enhance careers
                    isn&#39;t always a top priority. Scoring an interview means you have the technical
                    chops. After that, it&#39;s all about marketing yourself, asking the right questions,
                    making good connections, and choosing the paths that lead toward career goals. Without
                    those, you&#39;re just another number in a large crowd of engineers.</p>

                <p>Many recent grads like Jordan Duhe, a design engineer at Noble Plastics in Grand Coteau,
                    LA, picked up key intangibles on the job, with college providing a good educational
                    base. Colleges like Missouri University of Science and Technology organize projects and
                    competitions so students develop skills like negotiation, teamwork and presentation,
                    says Christopher Ramsay, the university&#39;s assistant vice provost for student design.

                    succeed in your job interviews and career.</p>

                <p><strong>1) Communicate:</strong> <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/business-communication">Communication</a>
                    is perhaps the biggest challenge for engineers, but it&rsquo;s also the most important
                    skill to pick up for a successful career. For some it&#39;s natural, for others it comes
                    via practice and being more social. &quot;You&#39;ve got to learn it as you go,&quot;
                    says Brandon Graham, experiential learning lab supervisor at Rowan Center for Innovation
                    and Entrepreneurship, who started developing his communication skills at the college
                    level. &quot;I wanted to be involved in clubs, and the only way to do that was to be
                    more social,&quot; Graham says. Engineers may relate to books like Dale Carnegie&#39;s
                    <em>Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking</em>, which provides a methodical and
                    structured way to pick up communication skills.</p>

                <p><strong>2) Presentation:</strong> Avoid jargon. Work on simplifying and crisply
                    explaining concepts, says Carlos Beatty, engineer and member of Fiat Chrysler
                    Automobiles&#39; corporate leadership development program. &quot;When you are in front
                    of management and people and they start to question, how do you deal with that?&rdquo;
                    Beatty says. &ldquo;It&#39;s one thing to give a presentation and be questioned, another
                    thing to give a presentation and be challenged.&quot; For a management position, the
                    ability to pull your ideas together and sway opinion is key. Brush up on Powerpoint too.

                <p><strong>3) Sell yourself:</strong> In the professional world, you are selling all the
                    time, whether it&rsquo;s ideas, answers, jobs, or products, says Nicole Salloum, a
                    consultant at Capgemini and professional trainer at ASME. &quot;Even when you are <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/about-asme/professional-membership/member-benefits/salary-services">negotiating
                        for a salary</a>, you are selling yourself,&quot; Salloum says. One of the best ways
                    to sell yourself is to prove yourself. Volunteer for additional assignments or projects
                    that will add to your skills, advance your career, and allow you to work with some of
                    the company&rsquo;s shining stars and key players.</p>

                <p><strong>4) Don&rsquo;t be just another engineer:</strong> If you score an engineering job
                    interview, it&rsquo;s assumed you have technical competence. But companies really want
                    differentiators. You could be a rock-star with a high GPA, but your importance boils
                    down to the value you provide to a company. Value needs to be built, and it can start in
                    job interviews, where good questions could impress interviewers, says Noble
                    Plastic&#39;s Duhe. Engineers with finance and technology skills are also highly sought.
                </p>

                <p><strong>5) Negotiate your value:</strong> Rookies can&rsquo;t go in and <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/technology-and-society/salaries-up-for-mechanical-engineers">demand
                        a salary</a>, but they can negotiate a position that could lead to higher pay in the
                    future. That&rsquo;s tied to the earlier point of differentiating yourself from others
                    and not being just another face in the crowd. &quot;If you negotiate your position,
                    that&#39;s different. In three years, you know your position and have a good projection,
                    that&rsquo;s when you put yourself at a point of leverage,&rdquo; Beatty says.
                    &ldquo;The purpose of leverage is so you know you have value. You know what that
                    monetary value is so you can differentiate. Without that, you&#39;re just another
                    number.&rdquo;</p>

                <p><strong>6) Self-confidence:</strong> Self-confidence is all about showing what
                    you&rsquo;re capable of doing, but building that can be challenging. For Salloum, it
                    meant doing new things. She took on a big challenge when she applied for a job working
                    on the supply chain for a spirits company. &quot;They are always afraid to send women -
                    for example to bars - for sales,&rdquo; Salloum says.<br />
                    &ldquo;Owners of bars may be more comfortable talking about this man to man.&quot;</p>
