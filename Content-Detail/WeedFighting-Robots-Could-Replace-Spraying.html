                <p>Most farmers today spray large amounts of <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/robotics/drone-on-the-farm">herbicides
                        over crops</a> that have been genetically modified to resist these chemicals. The global market
                    for herbicides is estimated at $25 billion, with three billion pounds&nbsp;of herbicides used every
                    year.</p>
                <p>Indiscriminant crop spraying has negative impacts to the environment, including toxic runoff that can
                    pollute water sources and harm human health. And after 20 years of heavy spraying, weeds have grown
                    resistant to glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsanto&rsquo;s Roundup, reducing its effectiveness
                    as a weed killer.</p>

                <p>However, robots may be coming to the rescue. Several <a

                        technology</a> companies are developing weed-killing robots that selectively poison weeds with
                    microbursts of herbicides, vastly reducing the amount of herbicides used by farmers. These robots
                    roll through the fields, using sophisticated computer vision systems to identify individual weeds
                    along their routes. This technology is also cheaper than widespread spraying, allowing farmers to
                    reduce their costs and, in the process, disrupt the multibillion-dollar herbicide business.</p>

                <p>EcoRobotix and Blue River Technologies are two companies that are close to commercializing their
                    robot systems.</p>

                <p><strong>For You: <a

                <p>EcoRobotix has designed an autonomous, seven-foot-wide robot equipped with a camera, GPS, artificial
                    intelligence, and two robotic arms that apply herbicide when weeds are identified. Being <a

                    it can work up to 12 hours a day without human intervention. With a weight of 130
                    kg&nbsp;distributed over four wheels, the robot does not compact soil and can work with more
                    sensitive crops that heavier spray systems cannot. The vision system enables the robot to follow
                    crop rows and detect the presence and position of weeds in and between the rows.</p>

                <p>When a weed is located, it is covered by a cup on the end of a robot arm, which then delivers a
                    microdose of herbicide into the cup. The robot adapts its speed to the concentration of weeds and is
                    most effective in fields where the level of concentration is low to moderate, so it can cover the
                    ground at a reasonable speed (about five acres a day). It can be completely controlled and
                    configured

                    <p>Blue River Technology is developing a tractor attachment that uses robotic nozzles to deliver
                        herbicides to kill weeds. Massive libraries of plant images, computer vision, and artificial
                        intelligence allows the system to identify virtually every plant in the field. It does not rely
                        on spacing or color to identify weeds: it instantaneously recognizes the difference between
                        plants, even under conditions that challenge the human eye. The system also makes adjustments
                        and learns as it goes. In a unique &quot;closed-loop&quot; cycle, a second set of cameras allows
                        it to check the robot&rsquo;s work as it gathers data on the tens of thousands of plants in each
                        field. The robot has been tested in U.S. cotton fields, is towed by a tractor, and could reduce
                        herbicide use by up to 90 percent, according to the company.</p>

                    <p>Deere &amp; Co. bought Blue River Technologies for $305 million in 2017. The company&rsquo;s
                        intellectual property will be a key resource for Deere&rsquo;s new AI Lab, which will focus on
                        the use of artificial intelligence to help farmers grow enough food for an exploding global
                        population. &ldquo;What [this technology] allows us to do is move to the plant level, and start
                        managing at that plant level,&rdquo; says Alex Purdy, director of John Deere Labs.
                        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s going to have transformative power in agriculture, both in terms of yield
                        but also in terms of cost for growers.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>The plant-by-plant approach marks a major shift in agriculture from standard mass-spraying
                        methods. Not only does it vastly reduce the amounts of toxic chemicals applied to farmland, it
                        saves farmers roughly 30 percent compared to mass spraying. This creates more room for
                        experimenting with more exotic and less toxic (or even organic) herbicides.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;re now giving the grower an order of magnitude reduction in the amount of
                        herbicide they&rsquo;re using, all of a sudden these more expensive, exotic herbicides are now
                        in play again,&rdquo; says Willy Pell, director of new technology for Blue River
                        Technologies.<br />
                        If continued advances in plant-by-plant weed control result in robots that manually weed plants,
                        the need for herbicide applications will be significantly reduced, or even eliminated.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Our motivation was environmental in the first place, with the reduction of herbicides, but
                        we would also like to try to make work on the soil look more attractive to the successive
                        generations,&rdquo; says Steve Tanner, co-founder of EcoRobotix. &ldquo;In creating this
                        innovative working tool, adapted to the needs of farmers for whom soil conservation is a
                        priority, we likewise aim to demonstrate that high-tech has a place in the agriculture of
                        tomorrow, alongside traditional inherited wisdom. This is not intended to devalue human labor,
                        but makes it less taxing and less hazardous to health, while being sustainable in both
                        ecological and economic terms.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
