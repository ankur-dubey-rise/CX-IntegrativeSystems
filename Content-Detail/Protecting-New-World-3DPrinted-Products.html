                      <p>The number of 3D-printed, critical components grows each day. They make their way into
                          vehicles, aircraft, medical devices, prostheses, human bodies, and military applications. 
                          With that increase comes more opportunities for bad actors to hack the additive
                          manufacturing industry, potentially jeopardizing the products meant to improve our health
                          and safety. </p>
                      <p>So far, no major hacks have been reported in the emerging industry, says Raheem Beyah, a
                          professor at Georgia Institute of Technology&rsquo;s School of Electrical and Computer
                          Engineering. He wants to keep it that way. </p>

                              says. Corporate saboteurs, nation states, and disgruntled employees are just a few of
                              the groups he says will target AM and the products it generates. </p>

                      <p>To ease those concerns, Beyah and a team of researchers from Georgia Tech and Rutgers
                          University have developed a three-layer system designed to verify that 3D printed objects
                          have not been compromised.  It uses acoustic measurements, printer component tracking, and
                          detectable nanorods to protect the integrity of printed products. The system works
                          independently of corporate computer networks, removing one of the major gateways to
                          cybercrime.</p>
                      <p>&ldquo;We have plenty of cyber protections, but it will take a new kind of security to
                          protect the physical side,&rdquo; says Beyah, who has a deep background in <a
                              href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/pandoras-net"
                              title="Pandora’s Net">cybersecurity</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new day. It&rsquo;s going
                          to be critical to make sure everything is secure.&rdquo;</p>
                      <p>He&rsquo;s not the only one who thinks so. Last summer, the National Science Foundation
                          awarded the team a three-year, $250,000 grant to continue to improve and strengthen the
                          system. </p>
                      <p>All of the metrics captured through each segment of the security system are compared to what
                          Beyah calls the &ldquo;golden copy,&rdquo; which includes a properly printed finished
                          product and the documentation of the printer&rsquo;s key performance metrics during the
                          production process. The researchers tested their security system using different types of 3D
                          printers and a computer numerical control machine while manufacturing a polyethylene tibial
                          knee prosthesis. They then compared different stages of the printing processes to the golden
                          copy. &ldquo;We got close to one hudred percent accuracy on the tests,&rdquo; Beyah says.
                      </p>
                      <p>The system&rsquo;s three components include an acoustic monitor made up of inexpensive
                          microphones located above and/or around the printer and filtering software that detect
                          changes in the usual sound a printer makes. The software, he says, works in much the same
                          way as the Shazam and SoundHound apps that can accurately identify millions of different
                          songs through the microphone of a <a

                      <p>&ldquo;The basic thesis is that you have mechanical components that have to make some
                          noise,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m printing the same exact thing, the printer
                          should sound the exact same way when I make the next copy.&rdquo;</p>
                      <p>
                          The system&rsquo;s physical tracking piece uses linear potentiometers and gyroscopic sensors
                          placed on the extruders to make sure they follow the same path when printing the same
                          objects. </p>
                      <p>To detect variations or flaws in the final product, the researchers placed gold nanorods into
                          the filament material used in the printer. They used Raman spectroscopy and computed <a

                              target="_blank">tomography</a> to detect the location of the nanorods in the final
                          product. &ldquo;I know beforehand where I&rsquo;m going to place them,&rdquo; Beyah says,
                          adding that the nanorods don&rsquo;t affect the integrity of the material. &ldquo;Think of
                          it as a 3D watermark.&rdquo;</p>
                      <p>Beyah is using the grant, in part, to improve the accuracy of the system&rsquo;s sensors and
                          the microphones, especially when it comes to isolating and focusing on the noise one printer
                          makes from the others around it. The researchers are experimenting with different camera
                          arrays that can be used to monitor stages of the printing process in real time. </p>
                      <p>Beyah says the system is proof-of-concept but feels it could be ready for market in about a
                          year. A major selling point, he says, is that it doesn&rsquo;t have to operate on a
                          connected network. </p>

                          design on a computer, pushing the design package over the network to the printer,
                          downloading printer firmware – Beyah believes extra layers of protection can&rsquo;t come
                          fast enough to the AM industry.</p>

                      <p>&ldquo;Think about the entire 3D-printing ecosystem and all of its different stages; the
                          software, the STL file, the OS, the firmware can be compromised. The network&rsquo;s
                          intrusion detection system can be bypassed,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We need something in
                          addition to protect the system.&rdquo;</p>
