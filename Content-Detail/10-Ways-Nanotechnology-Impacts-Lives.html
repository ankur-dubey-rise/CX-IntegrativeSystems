                    Nanotechnology is a common word these days, but many of us don&rsquo;t realize the
                    amazing impact it has on our daily lives. According to the <a href="http://www.nano.gov/"
                        title="">United States National Nanotechnology
                        Initiative</a>, nanotechnology is &ldquo;science, engineering, and technology
                    conducted at the <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/building-a-nanoscale-railroad"
                        title="">nanoscale</a>, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers.&rdquo; One nanometer is
                    a billionth of a meter, or 10-9 of a meter. For comparison, a sheet of newspaper is
                    about 100,000 nanometers thick. Scientists are discovering that atoms and molecules
                    behave differently at the nanoscale.</p>
                <p>
                    It is also a rapidly expanding field. Scientists and engineers are having great success
                    making materials at the nanoscale to take advantage of enhanced properties such as
                    higher strength, lighter weight, increased electrical conductivity, and chemical
                    reactivity compared to their larger-scale equivalents.</p>

                <p>
                    1. Faster, smaller, and more powerful computers that consume far less power, with
                    longer-lasting batteries. Circuits made from carbon nanotubes could be vital in
                    maintaining the growth of computer power, allowing Moore&#39;s Law to continue.</p>
                <p>
                    2. Faster, more functional, and more accurate medical diagnostic equipment. <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/pharma-dips-into-organs-chips"
                        title="">Lab-on-a-chip</a> technology enables point-of-care testing in real time,
                    which speeds up delivery of medical care. Nanomaterial surfaces on implants improve wear
                    and resist infection.</p>

                    within the body and make them easier to deliver, often through combination medical

                    such as cancer cells.</p>

                    from <a

                        title="">nanocomposite</a> materials that are lighter, stronger, and more chemically
                    resistant than metal. Nanofilters remove nearly all airborne particles from the air
                    before it reaches the combustion chamber, further improving gas mileage.</p>
                <p>
                    5. Nanoparticles or <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/cotton-candy-inspires-new-nanofiber-process"
                        title="">nanofibers</a> in fabrics can enhance stain resistance, water resistance,
                    and flame resistance, without a significant increase in weight, thickness, or stiffness
                    of the fabric. For example, &ldquo;nano-whiskers&rdquo; on pants make them resistant to
                    water and stains.</p>
                <p>
                    6. Water filters that are only 15-20 nanometers wide can remove nano-sized particles,
                    including virtually all viruses and bacteria. These cost-efficient, portable water
                    treatment systems are ideal for improving the quality of drinking water in emerging
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    7. <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/environmental-engineering/making-carbon-nanotubes-safer-environment"
                        title="">Carbon nanotubes</a> have a variety of commercial uses, including making
                    sports equipment stronger and lighter weight. For example, a tennis racket made with
                    carbon nanotubes bends less during impact, and increases the force and accuracy of the
                    delivery. Nanoparticle-treated tennis balls can keep bouncing twice as long as standard
                    tennis balls.</p>
                <p>
                    8. Most sunscreens today are made from nanoparticles that effectively absorb light,
                    including the more dangerous ultraviolet range. They also spread more easily over the
                    skin. These same nanoparticles are also used in food packaging to reduce UV exposure and
                    prolong shelf life.</p>
                <p>
                    9. Many drink bottles are made from plastics containing nanoclays, which increase
                    resistance to permeation by oxygen, carbon dioxide, and moisture. This helps retain
                    carbonation and pressure and increases shelf life by several months.</p>
                <p>
                    10. Thanks to nanotechnology, a huge variety of chemical sensors can be programmed to
                    detect a particular chemical at amazingly low levels, for example, a single molecule out
                    of billions. This capability is ideal for surveillance and security systems at labs,
                    industrial sites, and airports. On the medical front, <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/nanotechnology/nano-sensors-for-cyborg-flesh"
                        title="">nanosensors</a> can also be used to accurately identify particular cells or
                    substances in the body.</p>
                <h3>
                    On the Horizon</h3>
                <p>
                    These are just a few of the thousands of ways that nanotechnology impacts society.
                    Important nanotechnology achievements seem to be announced almost daily. For example,
                    researchers at George Washington University have discovered a way to draw carbon dioxide
                    from the atmosphere and convert it into high-yield carbon nanofibers that can be used in
                    manufacturing.</p>
                <p>
                    &quot;Such nanofibers are used to make strong <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/nanotechnology/greener-aerospace-with-nanotechnology"
                        title="">carbon composites</a>, such as those used in the Boeing Dreamliner, as well
                    as in high-end sports equipment, wind turbine blades, and a host of other
                    products,&quot; says chemistry professor Stuart Licht, who led the research team.</p>
                <p>
                    The process is powered by a hybrid system consisting of solar cells and a thermal energy
                    collector that draws very little energy. Licht estimates that if the process was scaled
                    up to cover a physical area less than 10 percent of the size of the Sahara Desert,
                    within a decade it would reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to pre-industrial
                    levels.</p>
                <p>
                    When asked about nanotechnology&rsquo;s greatest potential for improving the state of
                    the world, Markus Antonietti, director of Max Planck Institute of Colloids and
                    Interfaces at Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, responded it was the
                    purification of air and water.</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;The technology already exists to fix the atmosphere,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But
                    there also needs to be a focus on education and getting information to the public at
                    large. Most people still don&rsquo;t know about these technologies. The best part is
                    that all of this could happen immediately, if we simply spread the information in an
                    understandable way. People don&rsquo;t read science journals, so they don&rsquo;t even
                    know that all of this is possible.&rdquo;</p>
