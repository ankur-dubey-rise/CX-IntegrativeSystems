                        <p>When his girlfriend needed heart surgery a few years ago, Dillon Hurd, then an
                            engineering major at Iowa State University, did what engineers do best: He began <a

                                design a machine</a> that could serve as an &ldquo;artificial heart&rdquo; while
                            patients wait for transplants or surgery.</p>

                        <p>These types of <a
                                href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/fluids-engineering/hearts-on-their-minds"
                                title="Hearts on Their Minds">heart pumps</a>, called left ventricle assist
                            devices (LVADs), already exist, though only a few companies make them. Patients use
                            them&nbsp;from the time of heart failure until surgery. People who are over 70 or in
                            poor health, who don&rsquo;t qualify for a heart transplant, also use them. Many of
                            the machines are large and cumbersome.</p>

                        <p>Being an engineer, Hurd believed he could create a better solution. So he began
                            designing an LVAD that would be lighter and more mobile. &nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Hurd&rsquo;s girlfriend is now his wife and, a few years after the surgery, is doing
                            well. The LVAD he designed is now Hurd&rsquo;s Ph.D. project at Iowa State.
                            He&rsquo;s also the founder of Hurd Health Group, which is gathering funding to
                            bring his &ldquo;SymVitae&rdquo; wireless LVAD to market.</p>

                            class="getty-image1">

                        <p>The SymVitae differs from heart-assist products on the market because it uses a
                            brushless electric motor as well as magnets placed on the inside and outside of the
                            left ventricle. The magnets help guide the blood through the ventricles, while the
                            electric motor pumps it through. &nbsp;Current devices rely on turbine engines to
                            pump blood.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re like a small jet turbine in your chest connected to a car
                            battery that you have to carry around all day. Their turbine design is inspired by
                            NASA, so they really are small jet engines in every sense,&rdquo; he says.
                            &ldquo;They&rsquo;re placed by coring into the heart, like you&rsquo;d remove a core
                            with an apple. They stitch on a pump, then run a tube to the aorta and stitch it on
                            there to bypass the left ventricle.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>The pumps, attached to the aorta, also come in contact with the blood supply, which
                            can cause blood clots. &ldquo;If you throw a clot, it&rsquo;s right in your
                            aorta,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It can result in a life threatening situation or cause
                            a stroke.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>The SymVitae skirts the patient&rsquo;s aorta and doesn&rsquo;t touch the circulatory
                            system.</p>




                        <img class="secondary-image image-with-caption widget float-left figure"
                            src="https://cdn.asme.org/getmedia/4909a2e9-6305-4e83-8ee3-93bbb1849315/Student-Designed-Heart-Pump-is-Lighter-Than-the-Rest_03.gif.aspx?width=340"

                        <p>Hurd&rsquo;s device calls for minimally invasive surgery to implant the magnets. An
                            internal charging pad and battery pack powers the magnets, which create a natural
                            force that pulls the blood through the heart.</p>

                        <p>The patient wears an external charging pad and battery pack around his waist, which
                            is hooked to the inner charging pack and battery. These batteries are wirelessly
                            charged. Foreign materials don&rsquo;t touch the blood, which pulsates and moves
                            with the heart&rsquo;s natural rhythm.</p>

                        <p>Because the SymVitae is comprised of small components, surgery to implant them is
                            less invasive than with other LVADs, he says.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;You can implant this without having to open up the sternum by breaking
                            it,&rdquo; Hurd says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hard surgery in itself, and if
                            you&rsquo;re in heart failure you&rsquo;re not super healthy to begin with. Less
                            invasive surgery means a better chance of success.&rdquo;<br />
                            <br />
                            The SymVitae will weigh around 300g (.66 lbs), while current LVADs typically weigh
                            around 400g (.88 lbs) according to Hurd&rsquo;s calculations. But the batteries and
                            controller for those systems typically weigh about 18 lbs. Hurd says his entire
                            system will be totally implanted and won&rsquo;t weigh more than 3 lbs., while his
                            battery belt will weigh about 5 lbs.<br />
                            &nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Hurd Health Group&rsquo;s next step is to apply for funding from the National
                            Institute of Health and the National Science Foundation and a host of other agencies
                            and organizations. &ldquo;The road ahead is to work further on the device,&rdquo;
                            Hurd says.</p>

                        <p>That means performing trials and tests, with the eventual goal of receiving FDA
                            clearance.</p>

                        <p>Now, Hurd is enjoying time with his wife, the impetus for his fledgling business, and
                            developing a device that might help people with heart failure live longer and easier
                            lives.</p>
