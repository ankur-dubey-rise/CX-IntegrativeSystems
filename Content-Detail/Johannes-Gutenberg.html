                <p>The significance of Johannes Gutenberg's (Circa 1398 &ndash; 1468) contributions to printing
                    and their impact on greatly expanding opportunities for literacy and learning, particularly
                    among lay people, cannot be overstated. In fact, some assert that no invention in the
                    history of man has had a greater influence on society than the introduction of printing in
                    the 15th century. Contemporary commentators say his work led to an &quot;information
                    revolution&quot; that can be likened to what has happened with the development of the
                    Internet today.</p>
                <p>Universally recognized and credited with inventing the printing press, Gutenberg actually
                    aggregated a number of inventions and processes to make mass-production of printed books
                    economical for both printers and readers. Other individuals in other countries were known to
                    have been developing a printing press, but key to Gutenberg's work was not only the
                    development of a process for mass-producing movable type but also the use of good quality
                    oil-based inks. Unlike standard water-based inks, the new oil-based inks could easily
                    transfer from metal to paper. Those were melded with the adaptation of a wooden oil or wine
                    screw-type press for printing.</p>

                <p>Prior to the use of movable type, books in Europe were typically handwritten manuscripts
                    while paper money, playing cards, posters, and the like were block-printed from hand-carved
                    wooden blocks, inked, and transferred to paper. Gutenberg's movable type involved metal
                    letters at the end of a metal shaft that could be produced in quantity, arranged, and moved
                    around so that mistakes could be corrected easily, and the type could economically be reused
                    for&nbsp;the next project. Both of the earlier methods of reproduction were expensive and
                    time-consuming. The combination of movable type, oil-based inks, and a workable press
                    revolutionized European bookmaking and spread rapidly across the continent and later the
                    world.</p>
                <p>Little is known about Gutenberg's early life, even the exact year of his birth, or his adult
                    personal life. Biographers do not agree on the nature of his early training: Some say he
                    began focusing on mechanical arts at a very young age while others say he was trained as a
                    stonecutter and goldsmith. What is known is that he was born just before the turn of the
                    15th century in Mainz, Germany, and moved to Strasbourg in the early 1430s, where he made a
                    living as an inventor, coming up with a new technique for polishing gemstones, making
                    mirrors for pilgrims visiting holy sites and other projects that he kept under wraps, which
                    could have been experiments leading to his printing process.</p>
                <p>He remained in Strasbourg for about a decade before returning to Mainz. There is little
                    information for about a decade but it is believed this is the period when he began
                    experimenting with printing single sheets of paper and small books before beginning work on
                    his famous Bible around 1450. The skills he developed during his time in Strasbourg and his
                    work with metals undoubtedly were valuable in developing a metal type suitable for printing,
                    believed to be an alloy of lead, tin, and other metals that would melt at low temperature,
                    cast well, and yet be durable when in a press.</p>

                <p>His major work, the <a title="Gutenberg Bible"
                        href="http://www.gutenbergdigital.de/gudi/eframes/index.htm">Gutenberg Bible</a>,
                    was completed by 1455 and sold at the Frankfurt Book Fair that year. The process to
                    produce them had to have been extended and labor-intensive because some 300 different
                    pieces of type are used to print the Bible. These first copies that were immediately
                    recognized for their high aesthetic and technical qualities were expensive, costing
                    several years' salaries for the average working man. However, the effect of the process
                    was to allow mass production and cut the costs of books, making information readily
                    available and easily accessible to a broad segment of the population.</p>
                <p>In the beginning, most books focused on religious topics. As <a title="Gutenberg's Legacy"
                        href="http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/educator/modules/gutenberg/books/legacy/">book
                        printing</a> spread to incorporate a range of topics, the impact of Gutenberg's work
                    was recognized as instrumental in laying the groundwork for a modern knowledge-based
                    economy and participation by the masses. Gutenberg himself did not reap great benefits.
                    In fact, a legal document dated 1455 indicates that a wealthy business partner sued him
                    for the return of monies loaned. This money was likely used in developing his process
                    and printing the Bible. He lost the suit and is believed to have had to turn over some
                    of his printing equipment. Not much else is known about the rest of his life except that
                    he was given a pension by the Archbishop of Mainz and lived in his hometown until his
                    death in 1468.</p>
