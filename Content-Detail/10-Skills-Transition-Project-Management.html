                <p>One of the advantages of an engineering degree is that it&rsquo;s flexible. There&rsquo;s
                    a lot more you can do with your degree and experience than the hands-on problem solving
                    that you&rsquo;re probably used to.</p>

                <p>And you don&rsquo;t even need to give up the STEM aspects of the job.</p>

                    provide engineers with the opportunity to continue working directly on engineering
                    projects while gaining new skills and, most importantly, offering you the chance to move
                    up in your field.</p>

                <h3>What Is Project Management?</h3>

                <p>A project manager is responsible for the planning, oversight, and completion of a
                    project, overseeing workers, the schedule, and the overall budget. They work on
                    engineering projects, as well as software, IT, construction, and a wide variety of other
                    large-scale projects.</p>

                <p>This is a vital role for any project. Without <a

                        execution</a>, a given project could get held up by any unexpected problem, which
                    could cause a serious hit to the project&rsquo;s overall efficiency or even lead to
                    project failure.</p>

                <p>Even though the job involves planning and oversight, a lot of problem solving is still
                    involved in project management. A project manager is also responsible for process
                    development, which means you&rsquo;ll be solving the biggest problem of all: How to
                    ensure each project is completed in the most streamlined, efficient way possible.
                    It&rsquo;s also the responsibility of the project manager to conduct <a

                        title="Safety and Risk Assessment">risk assessments</a> and develop contingency
                    plans to make sure there is a solution to every potential problem, so that the projects
                    don&rsquo;t experience any unnecessary delays or expenses.</p>

                <p>What are the skills required for project management?</p>

                <p>Project management is no easy task. In addition to great analytical skills, project
                    managers must have strong people skills. After all, it&rsquo;ll be your job to manage
                    and interact with a wide variety of people every day, such as the clients, bosses,
                    engineers, and crews you&rsquo;ll be overseeing.</p>

                <p class="mb-0">Terry Suffredini, PE, an engineering-focused career
                    coach, says these are some of the most important skills to develop if you want to be a
                    project manager:</p>

                <ul class="primary-list">
                    <li>Effective listening</li>
                    <li>Understanding and working collaboratively with <a
                            href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/technology-and-society/to-deal-with-difficult-people"
                            title="How to Deal with Difficult People">different personality styles</a></li>
                    <li>Motivating your team members</li>
                    <li>Diplomacy and conflict resolution between competing interests</li>
                    <li>Flexibility</li>
                    <li>Availability&mdash;to your clients and your team members, even after normal work
                        hours</li>
                    <li>Management of time and resources</li>
                    <li>Understanding how to budget and control costs</li>
                    <li>Schedule maintenance</li>
                    <li>Being both a strong leader of your team and crew and a strong follower of your own
                        managers and clients</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Adding these to your analytical skill will help you
                    with more than just a project management position. These skills are transferrable across
                    multiple disciplines, meaning they can help you in your engineering role, make you a
                    desirable candidate for career advancement, and help you entirely pivot your career.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Engineers who have good people skills to go along with their understanding and
                    knowledge of the technical side will always be in demand,&rdquo; says Suffredini.</p>

                <h3>Why Get into Project Management?</h3>

                <p>First, the obvious advantage: Positions involving management and oversight typically come
                    with a higher salary range. While the median <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/technology-and-society/salaries-up-for-mechanical-engineers"
                        title="Salaries Are Up for Mechanical Engineers">salary for mechanical engineers</a>
                    in the United States is $124,000 according to a recent ASME survey, the median income
                    for project managers can often be well above this amount.</p>

                <p>As a project manager, there also tend to be more career opportunities with a wider
                    variety, which means less chance of getting bored as you progress through your career.
                </p>

                <p>But higher compensation often comes at a price. You might have to work longer hours, be
                    on call at all hours, and generally bear the weight of much greater responsibility.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;When you make a mistake, it can impact a lot of people&#39;s lives and careers
                    because it impacts the business. There&#39;s just a lot that&#39;s involved,&rdquo;
                    Suffredini says.</p>

                <h3>A Changing Field</h3>

                <p>The project management career path has changed quite a bit over the past 10 years,
                    becoming much more client-centric and focused on the big picture.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;It has become increasingly important to focus on giving the client a good
                    experience,&rdquo; Suffredini says, explaining that this has become especially true in
                    the wake of the downturn in the oil and gas industry. &ldquo;Competition is fierce and
                    clients are looking for value for their dollars.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>As such, it&rsquo;s become all the more important for engineering firms to stay on
                    schedule and on budget, while bearing the client&rsquo;s preferences in mind. Project
                    managers need to be responsive and view the project from the client&rsquo;s perspective
                    in order to help meet the client&rsquo;s needs and goals as efficiently as possible.</p>

                <p>A person with excellent technical skills does not always make the best manager, and
                    that&rsquo;s OK; technical experts will always be needed. An engineering project
                    can&rsquo;t be completed without the engineer, after all.</p>

                <p>But if you&rsquo;re ready for new responsibilities, want to hone your people skills, and
                    are looking for an opportunity to grow both personally and professionally, then project
                    management might be the right step to take you in that direction.</p>
