                <p>Genetic engineering is on the cusp of transformational change, thanks to CRISPR-Cas9,
                    a <a

                        tool</a> that came to the forefront in 2012.
                </p>
                <p>Created by co-inventor Jennifer Doudna, a molecular biologist at University of
                    California-Berkeley, CRISPR-Cas9 allows scientists to alter the DNA of different
                    organisms with high speed and precision (until just recently, engineering genes was
                    a time-consuming and laborious procedure that often ended in failure).</p>

                <p>CRISPR works by injecting a DNA construct into a living organism. The construct is
                    composed of the Cas9 enzyme that cuts or deletes a segment of DNA, a sequence of RNA
                    that guides the Cas9 to the correct location to cut, and a new DNA template that
                    repairs the cut and alters the gene.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;We are getting to a point where we can investigate different combinations of
                    genes, controlling when, where, and how much they are expressed, and investigate the
                    roles of individual bases of DNA,&rdquo; states Nicola Patron, a molecular and
                    synthetic biologist at the Earlham Institute in the UK, in a recent article on <a
                        href="https://www.vox.com/">vox.com</a>. &ldquo;Understanding what DNA sequences
                    do is what enables us to solve problems in every field of biology from curing human
                    diseases, to growing enough healthy food, to discovering and making new medicines,
                    to understanding why some species are going extinct.&rdquo;</p>
                <h3>Eight Impacts of CRISPR</h3>
                <p>Below are eight ways that CRISPR will likely impact the world:</p>
                <ol class="primary-order">
                    <li><a
                            href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/microengineering-targets-malaria">Remove
                            malaria from mosquitos.</a> Scientists have created mosquitoes that are
                        resistant to malaria by deleting a segment of mosquito DNA. The altered mosquitos
                        passes on the resistance genes to 99 percent of their offspring, even when they
                        mated with normal mosquitos.</li>

                    <li>Treating Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. CRISPR-based platforms have been developed to
                        identify the genes controlling the cellular processes that lead to <a
                            href="http://ebooks.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/content.aspx?bookid=283&amp;sectionid=38778588">neurodegenerative
                            diseases</a> like Alzheimer&#39;s and Parkinson&#39;s, hopefully leading to new
                        treatments.</li>

                    <li>Treating HIV. The HIV virus inserts its DNA into the cells of the human host.
                        CRISPR has been successful in removing the virus&rsquo;s DNA from the
                        patient&rsquo;s genome. Other genetic sequences will likely be found that eliminate
                        HIV, herpes, hepatitis, and other dangerous viruses.</li>

                    <li>Develop new drugs. Pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer AG are investing
                        hundreds of millions of dollars to develop CRISPR-based drugs to treat heart
                        disease, blood disorders, and blindness.</li>

                    <li>Livestock. CRISPR/Cas9 has been utilized in China to delete genes in livestock
                        that inhibit muscle and hair growth to grow larger stock for the country&#39;s
                        commercial meat and wool industries. This could become a common way in the future to
                        expand livestock industries.</li>

                    <li>Agricultural crops. Researchers are using CRISPR to discover new ways to improve
                        crop disease resistance and environmental stress tolerance in plants. If successful,
                        this could result in new crops to help feed the global population.</li>

                    <li> Develop new cancer treatments. CRISPR can modify immune cells to make them more
                        effective at targeting and destroying cancer cells. CRISPR can also be used evaluate
                        how genes can be studied to determine their sensitivity to new <a
                            href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/nanotechnology/fighting-cancer-as-a-mechanical-disease">anti-cancer
                            drugs</a>, thereby developing a personalized treatment plan with the best
                        possibility of success.</li>

                    <li>Reduce our need for plastic. CRISPR can be used to manipulate a type of yeast that
                        transforms sugars into hydrocarbons, which can be used to make plastic&mdash;greatly
                        reducing the need to rely on petroleum-based resources for plastics, easing stress
                        on the environment.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Editing Humans</h3>
                <p>Ethical issues abound for genetic engineering with CRISPR&mdash;especially in humans.
                    Many people are concerned about the creation of &quot;designer babies&quot; with
                    genetic enhancements. The technology could be used to create genetic discrimination
                    through eugenics. &ldquo;We could see the emergence of genetic haves and have nots,
                    leading to even greater inequality than we already live with,&rdquo; comments Marcy
                    Darnovsky of San Francisco&#39;s Center for Genetics and Society.</p>

                <p>The UK has formally approved gene editing in human embryos, for research purposes
                    only. In the U.S., a science advisory panel formed by the National Academy of
                    Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine has shown for modifying human embryos
                    with certain heritable diseases.</p>

                <p>CRISPR has the distinct ability to alter the course of human evolution&mdash;to
                    improve society for the greater good or, in the wrong hands, to diminish the human
                    experience. Most genetic engineers agree that they must proceed with caution and
                    good governance.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;There are thousands of applications for CRISPR,&rdquo; says Dr. Carl June, a
                    noted immunologist from the University of Pennsylvania. &ldquo;The sky is the limit.
                    But we have to be careful.&rdquo;</p>
