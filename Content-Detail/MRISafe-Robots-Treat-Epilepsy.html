                            <p>Epilepsy affects one in 100 people globally and is most commonly treated with
                                anti-seizure medicine or invasive surgery. Eric Barth, an associate professor of
                                mechanical engineering at Vanderbilt University, would like to change that.</p>

                            <p>The surgery to treat the condition also has its own risks. Beginning at the base of the
                                skull, <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/finding-heat-in-brain-surgery">neurosurgeons</a>
                                probe through nerves until they reach the hippocampus.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;For about 70 percent of seizures, it comes from neural instability, so when you
                                treat epilepsy surgically, they remove the hippocampus part of the brain,&rdquo; Barth
                                says. &ldquo;You figure out whether it&rsquo;s the right or left part [causing the
                                seizures] and it&rsquo;s an invasive surgery where you drill a hole in the side of <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/treating-body-mind-epilepsy-patients">the
                                    skull.</a> Recovery time alone with this surgery can be a couple months. We wanted
                                to find a way to avoid it.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>The solution Barth&rsquo;s team came up with was to go through the patient&rsquo;s cheek,
                                using a robot-assisted surgical procedure.</p>

                            <p><strong>For You:</strong> <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/5-innovative-medical-technologies-2018-part-1">This
                                    Year&rsquo;s Top 5 Innovative Medical Technologies&nbsp;</a></p>

                            <p>Once inside the patient&rsquo;s cheek, their procedure involves locating a structure
                                called the foramen ovale and &ldquo;sneaking up&rdquo; to the brain with a steerable
                                needle under MRI guidance, he says.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;We want to see where the needle is going under the image and guide that needle to
                                the middle of the hippocampus. Then you heat the end of the needle up,&rdquo; he says.
                                &ldquo;That way, instead if removing the hippocampus, you try to treat the patient
                                through heating.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>The procedure is <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/surgical-robot-works-within-mri">guided
                                    by MRI</a>, so the team needed to design a robot that was MRI compatible.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;For MRI, they ask you to remove everything that&rsquo;s metal because the magnetic
                                fields are huge and you can&rsquo;t have anything metallic in there because it can
                                obscure the image,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Likewise, to have a robot inside the scanner
                                with you, that robot can&rsquo;t be made out of metals and motors and certain sensors.
                                Because of this, we made our robot all out of plastic and it uses these inflatable
                                bellows where you control it with air. You use this robot to steer the needle into the
                                hippocampus and go to the back end of it as they steer. Then you can see everything on
                                the scanner.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>The robot is shaped like two toilet paper roll-sized objects. One rotates a needle
                                helically&mdash;a corkscrew-style way in&mdash;and the second needle is in back.</p>

                            <p>The researchers have verified that the robot doesn&rsquo;t interfere with the scanner and
                                that there&rsquo;s accurate placement with the needle, he says. In addition, Will
                                Grissom, assistant professor in biomedical engineering at Vanderbilt, has developed
                                techniques in scanning protocols in order to image the needle with the MRI.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;We see the needle as it comes in and, as you retract the needle, you stick
                                something out of the end of it called the ablater, and you use laser energy and heat up
                                that tissue,&rdquo; Grissom says. &ldquo;Surgery as it&rsquo;s done now can lead to
                                patients possibly having to learn to talk again. We really hope our way can give them an
                                easier option.&rdquo;</p>
