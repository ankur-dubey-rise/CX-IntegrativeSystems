                                <p>Imagine adding wireless capabilities to a car, wearable device, piece of equipment,
                                    or a home appliance by just spraying on an antenna from a can.</p><br>

                                <p>Researchers at Drexel University say a spray made from MXene is the basis for
                                    next-generation antennae used for thin, flexible and transparent devices. A single

                                <p>&quot;When you make transparent devices, if you want IoT, you need to have

                                    professor at Drexel, adding that MXene can also be mixed with water or car paint.
                                    There may be many applications as IoT evolves.&rdquo;</p><br>

                                <p>Drexel researchers originally synthesized MXene, by mixing carbon or nitrogen with a
                                    metal carbide, in 2011 to create a practical alternative to <a
                                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/manufacturing-design/breakthrough-makes-graphene-easier-3d-print"
                                        title="Breakthrough Makes Graphene Easier to 3D Print">graphene</a>. They knew
                                    MXene was strong and durable, but the antenna behavior came as a surprise. The
                                    researchers, however, found the material retained its metal conductivity in bulk,
                                    making it an effective antenna. When they sprayed MXene ink onto an object, the
                                    researchers found it performed as good as copper antennas.</p><br>

                                <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Spraying MXene is like dropping many sheets of paper on a desk. They
                                    just come down and sit on the surface,&rdquo; Anasori says. &ldquo;There are many
                                    sheets of this, but they do not lose their metallic conductivity. That&#39;s a huge
                                    benefit for different applications like antenna.&rdquo;</p><br>

                                <p>The researchers made two strips of antennas with MXene sprayed on two films. A
                                    network analyzer used to test antennas recorded wireless performance at frequency
                                    ranges from 1.5GHz to 3.5GHz. They got peak performance &ndash; a measure of data
                                    speeds and signal reach &ndash; at the same 2.4GHz frequency used by Wi-Fi and
                                    Bluetooth. MXene is made from titanium carbide with carbon atoms in a 2D form. A
                                    layer of MXene consists of three layers of titanium atoms and two layers of carbon
                                    atoms.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    &ldquo;We wanted to see what substrates we could spray on,&rdquo; Anasori says.
                                    &ldquo;We spread it on paper but that adds roughness and thickness. We did it on
                                    transparent sheet with less surface roughness,&rdquo;</p><br>

                                <p>MXene is simple to produce. It takes an undergraduate student with little training
                                    about 24 ours to create 100 grams, Anasori says. That compares favorably to
                                    graphene, a hard-to-produce material also being researched as an antenna.</p><br>

                                <p>Antennae in today&rsquo;s wireless devices are typically attached to circuits, which
                                    will still be needed for MXene. But the material is easy to deposit and can be
                                    implemented in existing fabrication plants. Moreover, just a few grams of MXene can
                                    be spread across an entire football field, which means a lower volume would be
                                    required to put antennas on devices. Modems used in the latest phones have dozens of
                                    antennas and are complex to produce.</p><br>

                                <p>&quot;Having this simple processing and being transparent, it opens up a new
                                    direction of antennas,&rdquo; Anasori says.&nbsp;</p><br>

                                <p>The researchers will now formally study how MXene behaves like an antenna. One
                                    research area is to understand how 2D MXene sheets based on different metal carbides
                                    interact with electromagnetic waves, how it can form the ultimate application, and
                                    its frequency range. The research could also explore areas like communications
                                    range, which important in determining if the material could be used in modems for 5G
                                    communications, a critical component in connecting factories.</p><br>
