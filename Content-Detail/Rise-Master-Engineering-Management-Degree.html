<p>The Master of Engineering Management degree is on the rise. On the surface it might seem the degree is meant for engineers eager to climb a few rungs in their career, hone their business skills, or flex their leadership skills.</p>

<p>But Jeffrey Glass, faculty director of&nbsp;Duke University&rsquo;s Master of Engineering Management Program and a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the university, believes that any engineer could benefit from the degree. On the one hand, it&rsquo;s more common for engineers to find themselves in management positions early in their careers. More important is the <a href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/technology-and-society/measuring-motivation">changing nature</a> of engineering jobs at any level.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I think is a bigger driver for the Master of Engineering Management degrees that are coming up&mdash;and there are so many more than there were even five or ten years ago&mdash;is this idea that we no longer do engineering in a vacuum,&rdquo; Glass says.</p>

<p>The traditional engineer of yesterday was given an engineering problem to solve and then did it.&nbsp; In school, the approach is often underscored with problems that have clearly defined answers. That&rsquo;s not how it works in the real world anymore.</p>

<p>In earning an MEM degree, students learn the systems perspective, &ldquo;where you look at an organization and the problems you&rsquo;re trying to solve in a broader sense, not just from the simple engineering solution,&rdquo; Glass says. &ldquo;Now you have to solve a customer problem, an engineering problem, an organizational problem, and a stakeholder problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not only that engineers must now know the context of the problems they&rsquo;re working on. They are also faced with blurry end-zones and fuzzy data. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to have to decide when enough is enough and make a decision based on ambiguous information,&rdquo; Glass says, &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a huge shift in the mindset.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While <a href="http://memp.pratt.duke.edu/">the MEM program</a> trains engineers for the leadership skills and business acumen needed in managerial roles, the skills gained through the degree can be applied to many aspects of a job. Engineers with this broader outlook are more and more sought after, whatever the position they are being sought to fill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Companies are going to see them as much <a href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/technology-and-society/salaries-up-for-mechanical-engineers">more highly valued</a> because they understand some of the decisions that maybe can&rsquo;t be explained with the principles and the knowledge that a conventional engineer would have,&rdquo; Glass says. &ldquo;If they have this knowledge of the organizational context and the business context, they understand that, &lsquo;OK, there are things here that are not related to the technology or engineering. I can accept that.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p>It might seem, at first glance, that dealing with such ambiguity is antithetical to the typical engineering frame of mind. But this isn&rsquo;t necessarily the case. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve managed a lot of engineers, and what I love about it is that they are very analytical and willing to learn anything, anytime,&rdquo; Glass says. &ldquo;So that makes them very good in terms of management. The ambiguity problem is just a matter of practice, it&rsquo;s a matter of skill sets applied to a different environment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bottom line is that an MEM degree not only helps engineers be better managers, but trains them to be better overall employees. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not to set them up to be a manger right away, but to be the most effective engineer right away,&rdquo; Glass says.</p>
