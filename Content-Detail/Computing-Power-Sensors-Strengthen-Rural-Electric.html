                                it, especially those living in rural areas.</p>
                            <p >The U.S. Department of Energy is committed to closing that gap and has
                                earmarked nearly $10 million to support research that will advance and expand nationwide
                                service, building a more resilient power grid for everyone. As part of this, the agency
                                has invested $1.6 million into a project at The University of Texas at Austin&rsquo;s
                                Center for Electromechanics (CEM) that&rsquo;s working to improve real-time grid
                                monitoring systems, using sensor technologies and in-the-field data gathering.</p>
                            <p >The massive U.S. power grid is made up of nearly 160,000 miles of
                                high-voltage power lines, millions more miles of low-voltage lines, and more than 7,300
                                power plants. The network connects and provides power for some 145 million American
                                customers.</p>
                            <p >The network also gets smarter every year. Innovations such as renewable
                                power sources, solar photovoltaics and advanced <a

                                storage systems are bringing the power of distributed energy resources to the modern
                                grid, turning the legacy network from a one-way delivery system into a two-way street
                                for the flow of electricity. For consumers, these advancements can mean everything from
                                lower energy costs, to cleaner power to reduced greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

                            <p >Engineers familiar with multiple disciplines will be better prepared to work
                                with todayâ€™s product development teams, according to a survey by research firm Tech
                                Clarity. But nearly 40 percent of manufacturers polled said the evolving and changing
                                engineering skillsets needed for systems-driven product development is one of the
                                biggest workforce challenges. We covered many of those trends during 2018.</p>



                            <p >Rural areas, located far away from the bulk of U.S. energy infrastructure,
                                have long struggled to maintain their power distribution systems. Much of rural Alaska,
                                for instance, is on isolated microgrids, serving 600,000-plus square miles of remote
                                towns and villages that aren&rsquo;t part of a larger grid. Many other rural parts of
                                the country are also isolated and often miss out on the reliability and efficiency of
                                modern grid technology.</p>

                            <p >The DOE and University of Texas hope to change that with their new program.
                            </p>

                            <p >&ldquo;The project that we&#39;re working on actually is an attempt to put
                                what is likely the largest amount of computing power hanging on a power line that&#39;s
                                ever been done,&rdquo; said Robert Hebner, CEM director and a research professor in the
                                school&rsquo;s Department of Mechanical Engineering. &ldquo;The reason for this is that
                                the utilities that serve rural areas have ways of looking at where lines are down
                                &ndash; such as where a tree limb is rubbing on a line or an insulator is cracked
                                &ndash; but they don&#39;t know well enough what&#39;s happening on a day-to-day basis
                                before something goes wrong.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p >Geographic precision matters in rural areas where many homes and other
                                structures are far apart, making it difficult to pinpoint or <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/selfhealing-wind-turbine-blades"
                                    title="Self-Healing Wind Turbine Blades">access problems in the field</a>. That
                                matters when a technician finds themselves on one side of a creek with the line they
                                need to repair on the other, and the nearest road across is 30 miles back.</p>

                            <p >The university&rsquo;s team combines computing power and field sensors with
                                advanced network modeling that enables utility companies to see exactly what is
                                happening on the grid and where any issues are, literally inch by inch and in real time.
                                Utility data acquisition and monitoring systems currently used by most utilities
                                aren&rsquo;t equipped for real-time monitoring of DERs or real-time processing of large
                                amounts of data.</p>

                            <p >&nbsp;By leveraging existing and emerging sensor technology, the researchers
                                hope to develop a system where a handful of sensors can cover an entire network.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;The sensors are line connected, meaning they don&#39;t need to be
                                grounded, so they can go on any power line,&rdquo; said Shannon Strank, CEM assistant
                                director. &ldquo;They&#39;re in a small form factor, so our premise is that they
                                won&#39;t pose any threat of damage to the line itself, and include built in GPS
                                triangulation so we can put as few sensors on the lines as we need to in order to get
                                the level of fidelity in terms of location determination as we need.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p >Operating costs are naturally a concern for many rural cooperatives, so
                                minimizing the number of sensors needed to monitor the grid is a priority.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;The beauty of what we&#39;re putting together is that that you can
                                count on two hands the number of sensors on the lines to cover what is quite a large
                                geographical area,&rdquo; Stank said. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a very minimal amount of
                                interplay that needs to come from the technicians themselves in order to do maintenance
                                on those sensors. So, it&#39;s low operating cost and minimal need to go out and check
                                on these sensors and maintain them.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p >The target right now is less than $1,000 per sensor, with fewer than a dozen
                                required to deliver significant benefits to rural cooperatives.</p>

                            <p >This work is all part of a nationwide push to make the grid more resilient
                                and robust, especially as power generation and distribution systems evolve over time.
                            </p>

                            <p >&ldquo;One of the bigger issues we&rsquo;re seeing is that, as we start
                                putting more and more renewables in distributed places throughout the grid, it gets
                                harder and harder to manage everything,&rdquo; Hebner said. &ldquo;This technology
                                should make it possible to significantly increase the amount of renewables that are in
                                the grid, particularly in these rural distribution grids.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p >For example, Texas has a sizable population of people living on isolated
                                ranches with their own solar panels and wind turbines who also need to connect to their
                                own local electric co-op to cover all of their energy needs. A more robust two-way grid,
                                helped by the team&rsquo;s new monitoring technology, will allow these rural consumers
                                to access more of the renewable energy sources, feeding power back into the system, and
                                reducing the reliance on traditional power plants.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;When you think about it, many rural utility co-ops generally have
                                fewer than seven meters per mile,&rdquo; Hebner said. &ldquo;I think in Chicago they
                                have something like 7,000 meters per mile. So cities don&rsquo;t need the same level of
                                sensitivity that they need in the country. But a lot of the information needs are
                                common, and I think we&rsquo;re going to find a much larger market for this technology
                                once these grid improvements start to roll out.&rdquo;</p>
