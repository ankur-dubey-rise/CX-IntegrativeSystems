<p>Hiring managers and recruiters alike say they&#39;ve seen more poorly written resumes cross their desks recently than ever before. Attract more interview offers and ensure your resume doesn&#39;t eliminate you from consideration by following these six key tips:</p>

<p><strong>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;Format Your Resume Wisely &quot;Do the Hiring Managers&quot; Work for Them</strong></p>

<p>No matter how well written, your resume won&#39;t get a thorough reading the first time through. Generally a resume gets scanned for 25 seconds. Scanning is more difficult if it is hard to read, poorly organized or exceeds two pages.</p>

<ul class="disc">
	<li>Use a logical format and wide margins, clean type and clear headings</li>
	<li>Selectively apply bold and italic typeface that help guide the reader&#39;s eye</li>
	<li>Use bullets to call attention to important points (i.e. accomplishments)</li>
</ul>

<strong>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;Identify Accomplishments not Just Job Descriptions</strong></p>

<p>Hiring managers, especially in technical fields like engineering, seek candidates that can help them solve a problem or satisfy a need within their company. Consequently, you can&#39;t be a solution to their problems without stating how you solved similar problems in other companies and situations.</p>

<ul class="disc">
	<li>Focus on what you did in the job, NOT what your job was there&#39;s a difference</li>
	<li>Include a one or two top line job description first, then list your accomplishments</li>
	<li>For each point ask yourself, What was the benefit of having done what I did?</li>
	<li>Accomplishments should be unique to you, not just a list of what someone else did</li>
	<li>Avoid using the generic descriptions of the jobs you originally applied for or held</li>
</ul>

<br />
<strong>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;Quantify Your Accomplishments</strong></p>

<p>Q: What&#39;s the most common resume mistake?<br />
A: Making too many general claims and using too much industry jargon that does not market the candidate. A resume is a marketing document designed to sell your skills and strengths rather than just portray a bio of the candidate.</p>

<ul class="disc">
	<li>Include and highlight specific achievements that present a comprehensive picture of your marketability</li>
	<li>Quantify your achievements to ensure greater confidence in the hiring manager and thereby generate interest percentages, dollars, number of employees, etc.</li>
	<li>Work backwards to quantify your accomplishments by asking, If I had not done X, what could have happened?</li>
</ul>

<strong>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;Cater Your Resume for the Industry</strong></p>

<p>Unlike advertising and design professionals who have greater creative license in designing their resume for those fields, the mechanical engineering industry won&#39;t be impressed and may be turned off by distinctive resume design.</p>

<ul class="disc">
	<li>Err on the side of being conservative stylistically</li>
	<li>Your accomplishments, error-free writing, grammatically-correct, clean, crisp type and paper will make the impression for you</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<strong>5</strong><strong>. &nbsp;&nbsp;Replace your Objective&quot; with a &quot;Career Summary&quot;</strong></p>

<p>A Career Summary is designed to give a brief overview of who you are and what you do. Most Objectives sound similar: Seeking a challenging, interesting position in X where I can use my skills of X, Y, and Z to contribute to the bottom line. Not telling at all.</p>

<ul class="disc">
	<li>Grab a hiring manager&#39;s attention right from the beginning, remembering you<br />
	have only 25 few seconds to make a good impression</li>
	<li>Spend time developing a summary that immediately gets their attention, and accurately and powerfully describes you as a solution to their problems</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<strong>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;Network. Network. Network.</strong></p>

<p>For unemployed candidates, handing out resumes should be a full-time job. The majority of mid- to senior-level positions are filled through networking, so contact absolutely everyone you know in addition to recruiters who are in a position to hire you or share insights. Networking can include</p>

<ul class="disc">
	<li>Personal business contacts, people you&#39;ve worked for or who worked for you</li>
	<li>Vendors and sales representatives you&#39;ve dealt with in the past five years</li>
	<li>People listed in the alumni directory of your alma mater</li>
</ul>

<p>With a solid resume in hand you&#39;ll greatly increase your odds of earning a closer look and getting that interview.<br />
