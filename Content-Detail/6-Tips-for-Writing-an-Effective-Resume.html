                <p>Hiring managers and recruiters alike say they&#39;ve seen more poorly written resumes
                    cross their desks recently than ever before. Attract more interview offers and
                    ensure your resume doesn&#39;t eliminate you from consideration by following these
                    six key tips:</p>
                <h3>1. Format Your Resume Wisely &quot;Do the Hiring Managers&quot;
                    Work for Them</h3>
                <p>No matter how well written, your resume won&#39;t get a thorough reading the first
                    time through. Generally a resume gets scanned for 25 seconds. Scanning is more
                    difficult if it is hard to read, poorly organized or exceeds two pages.</p>
                <ul class="primary-list">
                    <li>Use a logical format and wide margins, clean type and clear headings</li>
                    <li>Selectively apply bold and italic typeface that help guide the reader&#39;s eye
                    </li>
                    <li>Use bullets to call attention to important points (i.e. accomplishments)</li>
                </ul>

                </p>
                <h3>2. Identify Accomplishments not Just Job Descriptions</h3>
                <p>Hiring managers, especially in technical fields like engineering, seek candidates
                    that can help them solve a problem or satisfy a need within their company.
                    Consequently, you can&#39;t be a solution to their problems without stating how you
                    solved similar problems in other companies and situations.</p>

                <ul class="primary-list">
                    <li>Focus on what you did in the job, NOT what your job was there&#39;s a difference
                    </li>
                    <li>Include a one or two top line job description first, then list your
                        accomplishments</li>
                    <li>For each point ask yourself, What was the benefit of having done what I did?
                    </li>
                    <li>Accomplishments should be unique to you, not just a list of what someone else
                        did</li>
                    <li>Avoid using the generic descriptions of the jobs you originally applied for or
                        held</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Quantify Your Accomplishments</h3>
                <p><strong>Q: What&#39;s the most common resume mistake?</strong><br />
                    A: Making too many general claims and using too much industry jargon that does not
                    market the candidate. A resume is a marketing document designed to sell your skills
                    and strengths rather than just portray a bio of the candidate.</p>

                <ul class="primary-list">
                    <li>Include and highlight specific achievements that present a comprehensive picture
                        of your marketability</li>
                    <li>Quantify your achievements to ensure greater confidence in the hiring manager
                        and thereby generate interest percentages, dollars, number of employees, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>Work backwards to quantify your accomplishments by asking, If I had not done X,
                        what could have happened?</li>

                <h3>4. Cater Your Resume for the Industry</h3>
                <p>Unlike advertising and design professionals who have greater creative license in
                    designing their resume for those fields, the mechanical engineering industry
                    won&#39;t be impressed and may be turned off by distinctive resume design.</p>
                <ul class="primary-list">
                    <li>Err on the side of being conservative stylistically</li>
                    <li>Your accomplishments, error-free writing, grammatically-correct, clean, crisp
                        type and paper will make the impression for you</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Replace your Objective&quot; with a &quot;Career Summary&quot;</h3>
                <p>A Career Summary is designed to give a brief overview of who you are and what you do.
                    Most Objectives sound similar: Seeking a challenging, interesting position in X
                    where I can use my skills of X, Y, and Z to contribute to the bottom line. Not
                    telling at all.</p>

                <ul class="primary-list">
                    <li>Grab a hiring manager&#39;s attention right from the beginning, remembering
                        you<br />
                        have only 25 few seconds to make a good impression</li>
                    <li>Spend time developing a summary that immediately gets their attention, and
                        accurately and powerfully describes you as a solution to their problems</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>6. Network. Network. Network.</h3>

                <p>For unemployed candidates, handing out resumes should be a full-time job. The
                    majority of mid- to senior-level positions are filled through networking, so contact
                    absolutely everyone you know in addition to recruiters who are in a position to hire
                    you or share insights. Networking can include</p>
                <ul class="primary-list">
                    <li>Personal business contacts, people you&#39;ve worked for or who worked for you
                    </li>
                    <li>Vendors and sales representatives you&#39;ve dealt with in the past five years
                    </li>
                    <li>People listed in the alumni directory of your alma mater</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With a solid resume in hand you&#39;ll greatly increase your odds of earning a closer
                    look and getting that interview.</p>
