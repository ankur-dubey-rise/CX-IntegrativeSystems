                        <p>The axe is arguably one of the world&rsquo;s oldest engineered objects. Despite its early
                            provenance, the axe&rsquo;s essential design and operation have not changed much in its many
                            millennia of use: Whack a log with a heavy wedge and it splits the wood along the grain.</p>

                        <p>But now there&rsquo;s a new kid on the chopping block, a lopsided claw of a tool called the
                            &ldquo;Leveraxe.&rdquo;</p>

                            turns after it has penetrated the wood by five millimeters or so, changing from wedge to
                            lever and prying a section away from the greater log.</p>

                        <p>Mechanical engineer Joel George was working on a nuclear power station construction site in
                            Finland when he heard of the new axe. Within a week he was visiting inventor Heikki Kärnä.
                        </p>

                        <p>&ldquo;When I first used the Leveraxe, I was so surprised by how little force is needed for
                            the axe to lever the wood apart,&rdquo; George says.</p>

                        <p>Before he returned to his home in Blue Mountain Lake, NY, George agreed to become
                            Leveraxe&rsquo;s North American distributor.<br />

                            <strong>For You:</strong> <a

                        </p>

                        <p>The Leveraxe went through a few incarnations before it reached its current state of
                            simplicity and elegance. The axe was born shortly after Kärnä retired from his job as an air
                            traffic controller and moved to a new house in the middle of the woods. He&rsquo;d been
                            splitting wood his whole life, but he was tired of the problems that came with a traditional
                            maul. The head often gets stuck in the wood, and it also has a propensity to bounce and fly
                            off to toward the feet. That makes for hard work.</p>

                        <p>Kärnä&rsquo;s first attempt at remedying the situation was to bolt hockey pucks to both sides
                            of a maul head. This effectively kept the tool away from the feet by bouncing it back up off
                            the log. It also effectively killed <a
                                href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/strides-atomic-force-microscope-design"
                                title="Strides in Atomic Force">the force</a> needed to split the wood apart. Next he
                            tried bolting heavy washers to one side of the head. This introduced the prying action that
                            occurs after the head has struck wood. It worked.</p>

                        <p>The only problem was that after popping off a piece of wood, the axe head would slide off,
                            again endangering the lower extremities. So he welded studs to the thick end of the head to
                            catch the wood and keep it atop the log it was splitting. Since then, the Leveraxe&rsquo;s
                            head has become a single solid piece of cast or forged metal.</p>

                        <p>The final product is safer, requires less power, and is speedier at getting the job done.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;Rough theoretical calculations conclude that the Leveraxe is 30 times more powerful
                            than a traditional axe as it hits the wood because of the added torque that is created by
                            the counter weight,&rdquo; George says. &ldquo;The Leveraxe does not lose kinetic energy to
                            friction as do traditional axes because it penetrates into the wood on an optimum strike
                            only a quarter of an inch.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>An axeman hard at work on a log can split it up to five times as fast and with lower risk of
                            bodily harm.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;During the existence of the Leveraxe there have been no accidents,&rdquo; he says.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I do use it to split all my wood here in upstate New York,&rdquo; George adds.
                            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m blown away with its functionality, and its simplicity. It&rsquo;s very
