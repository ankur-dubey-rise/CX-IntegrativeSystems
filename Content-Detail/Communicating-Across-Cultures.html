                            <p class="mt-lg-0">Communicating across cultures is challenging. Each culture has set
                                rules that its members take for granted. Few of us are aware of our own cultural biases
                                because cultural imprinting is begun at a very early age. And while some of a
                                culture&#39;s knowledge, rules, beliefs, values, phobias, and anxieties are taught
                                explicitly, most of the information is absorbed subconsciously</p>
                            <p>The challenge for multinational communication has never been greater. Worldwide business
                                organizations have discovered that intercultural communication is a subject of
                                importance&mdash;not just because of increased globalization, but also because their
                                domestic workforce is growing more and more diverse, ethnically and culturally.</p>

                            <p >We are all individuals, and no two people belonging to the same culture are
                                guaranteed to respond in exactly the same way. However, generalizations are valid to the
                                extent that they provide clues on what you will most likely encounter when dealing with
                                members of a particular culture.</p>

                            <h3>High-Context vs. Low-Context</h3>

                            <p >All international communication is influenced by cultural differences. Even
                                the choice of communication medium can have cultural overtones. The determining factor
                                may not be the degree of industrialization, but rather whether the country falls into a
                                <i>high-context</i> or <i>low-context culture</i>.</p>

                            <p >High-context cultures (Mediterranean, Slav, Central European, Latin
                                American, African, Arab, Asian, American-Indian) leave much of the message unspecified,
                                to be understood through context, nonverbal cues, and between-the-lines interpretation
                                of what is actually said. By contrast, low-context cultures (most Germanic and
                                English-speaking countries) expect messages to be explicit and specific.</p>

                            <h3>Sequential vs. Synchronic </h3>

                            <p >Some cultures think of time sequentially, as a linear commodity to
                                &quot;spend,&quot; &quot;save,&quot; or &quot;waste.&quot; Other cultures view time
                                synchronically, as a constant flow to be experienced in the moment, and as a force that
                                cannot be contained or controlled.</p>

                            <p >In <i>sequential cultures</i> (like North American, English, German,
                                Swedish, and Dutch), businesspeople give full attention to one agenda item after
                                another.</p>

                            <p >In <i>synchronic cultures</i> (including South America, southern Europe and
                                Asia) the flow of time is viewed as a sort of circle, with the past, present, and future
                                all interrelated. This viewpoint influences how organizations in those cultures approach
                                deadlines, strategic thinking, investments, developing talent from within, and the
                                concept of &quot;long-term&quot; planning.</p>

                            <p >Orientation to the past, present, and future is another aspect of time in
                                which cultures differ. Americans believe that the individual can influence the future by
                                personal effort, but since there are too many variables in the distant future, we favor
                                a short-term view. Synchronistic cultures&rsquo; context is to understand the present
                                and prepare for the future. Any important relationship is a durable bond that goes back
                                and forward in time, and it is often viewed as grossly disloyal <i>not</i> to favor
                                friends and relatives in business dealings.</p>

                            <h3>Affective vs. Neutral</h3>

                            <p >In international business practices, reason and emotion both play a role.
                                Which of these dominates depends upon whether we are <i>affective</i> (readily showing
                                emotions) or emotionally <i>neutral</i> in our approach. Members of neutral cultures do
                                not telegraph their feelings, but keep them carefully controlled and subdued. In
                                cultures with high affect, people show their feelings plainly by laughing, smiling,
                                grimacing, scowling, and sometimes crying, shouting, or walking out of the room.</p>

                            <p >This doesn&#39;t mean that people in neutral cultures are cold or unfeeling,
                                but in the course of normal business activities, neutral cultures are more careful to
                                monitor the amount of emotion they display. Emotional reactions were found to be least
                                acceptable in Japan, Indonesia, the U.K., Norway, and the Netherlands and most accepted
                                in Italy, France, the U.S., and Singapore.</p>

                            <p >Reason and emotion are part of all human communication. When expressing
                                ourselves, we look to others for confirmation of our ideas and feelings. If our approach
                                is highly emotional, we are seeking a direct emotional response: &quot;I feel the same
                                way.&quot; If our approach is highly neutral, we want an indirect response: &quot;I
                                agree with your thoughts on this.&quot;</p>

                            <p >It&#39;s easy for people from neutral cultures to sympathize with the Dutch
                                manager and his frustration over trying to reason with &quot;that excitable
                                Italian.&quot; After all, an idea either works or it doesn&#39;t work, and the way to
                                test the validity of an idea is through trial and observation. That just makes
                                sense&mdash;doesn&#39;t it? Well, not necessarily to the Italian who felt the issue was
                                deeply personal and who viewed any &quot;rational argument&quot; as totally irrelevant!
                            </p>

                            <p >When it comes to communication, what&#39;s proper and correct in one culture
                                may be ineffective or even offensive in another. In reality, no culture is right or
                                wrong, better or worse&mdash;just different. In today&#39;s global business community,
                                there is no single best approach to communicating with one another. The key to
                                cross-cultural success is to develop an understanding of, and a deep respect for, the
                                differences.</p>
