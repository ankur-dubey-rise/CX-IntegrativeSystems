                                <p>Addie Wagenknecht loves creating art in unconventional ways. For years, she’s hacked
                                    drones and robots to generate images that are visually shocking, and has used
                                    electronics in stunning ways to create art.</p><br>
                                <p>Her latest art exhibition, called Alone Together, was no less shocking. Using a
                                    Roomba robotic <a
                                        href="https://www.asme.org/career-education/articles/entrepreneurship/the-man-behind-the-vacuum-cleaner">vacuum
                                        cleaner</a> as a paintbrush, the art focuses on the female body as a symbolic
                                    representation of how women’s rights are being suppressed.</p><br>
                                <p>“I see this as urgent work about where the female body belongs in the present and
                                    future possible,” Wagenknecht says.</p><br>
                                <p>In some ways, the streaks of blue donning <a
                                        href="http://memagazineselect.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=2676570">the
                                        art</a> were reminiscent of works from abstract artist Jackson Pollock. The
                                    Roomba’s guts had to be tweaked to make the device a sophisticated artist.</p>

                                <p>Wagenknecht took Roomba’s vacuum mechanism and reversed its polarity so it would no
                                    longer have suction but actually distribute the pigment. Liquefied pigment was
                                    sourced from a chemist in Paris and loaded in the robot.</p><br>
                                <p>“The blue, or rather how the medium encapsulated the blue, was developed specifically
                                    for [French artist] Yves Klein by a chemist in Paris. He had copyrighted the blue so
                                    no one else could use it, but I found the chemist store he used in Paris,” she says.
                                </p><br>
                                <p>There’s artificial intelligence at work in Wagenknecht’s art, as the final result is
                                    a void in the shape of a woman, painted by a robot learning the algorithm it
                                    intuited of her body.</p><br>
                                <p>A prior art series to Alone Together used drones to paint, with pigments sourced from
                                    India, and also Central Asia.</p><br>
                                <p>“The works are clues into the world technology and feelings that make up my
                                    experiences, but they aren’t explanations of them,” she adds.</p><br>
                                <p>Wagenknecht’s love for hacking and sculpture gives her close ties to the maker
                                    movement. She was one of the co-developers of the Lasersaur open source laser cutter
                                    in 2010. She also was an initial board member of the Open Source Hardware
                                    Association when it was formed in 2012. She’s worked with companies like Google on
                                    exploring the interdiv of art technology, and her work has been acquired by the
                                    Whitney Museum of American Art.</p><br>
                                <p>“For the last few years, I have been doing a lot with machine learning and AI,” she
                                    says. “I want to create works that discuss how we think about AI while forgetting
                                    that there is actual AI in the pieces.” she said.</p>
