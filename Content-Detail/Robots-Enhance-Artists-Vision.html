<p>Addie Wagenknecht loves creating art in unconventional ways. For years, she&rsquo;s hacked drones and robots to generate images that are visually shocking, and has used electronics in stunning ways to create art.</p>

<p>Her latest art exhibition, called Alone Together, was no less shocking. Using a Roomba robotic <a href="https://www.asme.org/career-education/articles/entrepreneurship/the-man-behind-the-vacuum-cleaner">vacuum cleaner</a> as a paintbrush, the art focuses on the female body as a symbolic representation of how women&rsquo;s rights are being suppressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see this as urgent work about where the female body belongs in the present and future possible,&rdquo; Wagenknecht says.</p>

<p>In some ways, the streaks of blue donning <a href="http://memagazineselect.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=2676570">the art</a> were reminiscent of works from abstract artist Jackson Pollock. The Roomba&rsquo;s guts had to be tweaked to make the device a sophisticated artist.</p>

<p>Wagenknecht took Roomba&rsquo;s vacuum mechanism and reversed its polarity so it would no longer have suction but actually distribute the pigment. Liquefied pigment was sourced from a chemist in Paris and loaded in the robot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The blue, or rather how the medium encapsulated the blue, was developed specifically for [French artist] Yves Klein by a chemist in Paris. He had copyrighted the blue so no one else could use it, but I found the chemist store he used in Paris,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s artificial intelligence at work in Wagenknecht&rsquo;s art, as the final result is a void in the shape of a woman, painted by a robot learning the algorithm it intuited of her body.</p>

<p>A prior art series to Alone Together used drones to paint, with pigments sourced from India, and also Central Asia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I started in around 2007 with &lsquo;Black Hawk Paint&rsquo; and &lsquo;Internet of Things&rsquo; using Roombas, respectively as a play on IoT technology and creating something playful with them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;My experience was always how they needed more work to maintain than they were actually useful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The works are clues into the world technology and feelings that make up my experiences, but they aren&rsquo;t explanations of them,&rdquo; she adds.</p>

<p>Wagenknecht&rsquo;s love for hacking and sculpture gives her close ties to the maker movement. She was one of the co-developers of the Lasersaur open source laser cutter in 2010. She also was an initial board member of the Open Source Hardware Association when it was formed in 2012. She&rsquo;s worked with companies like Google on exploring the intersection of art technology, and her work has been acquired by the Whitney Museum of American Art.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the last few years, I have been doing a lot with machine learning and AI,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I want to create works that discuss how we think about AI while forgetting that there is actual AI in the pieces.&rdquo; she said.</p>
