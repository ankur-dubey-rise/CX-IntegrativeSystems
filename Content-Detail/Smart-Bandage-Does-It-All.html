                                <p>In another example of how technology continues to transform healthcare, engineers at
                                    Tufts University have developed &ldquo;smart bandages&rdquo; that can actively
                                    monitor and deliver precisely targeted treatment to chronic wounds while also
                                    keeping the caregiver informed of the patient&rsquo;s progress.</p><br>

                                <p>Chronic wound treatment is a significant burden to patients and costly for the U.S.

                                        system</a>, exceeding $20 billion each year.</p><br>

                                <p>The bandages have been engineered to track <a

                                    healing process. The bandages have been tested in the lab and are now undergoing
                                    pre-clinical studies.</p>

                                    <h3>Smart bandages monitor and tailor treatment for chronic wounds</h3>
                                <p>In a recent paper for <a
                                        href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.201703509"><em>Small</em></a>,
                                    Prof. Sameer Sonkusale of Tufts University&rsquo;s School of Engineering and his
                                    team wrote that the problem with some existing dressings that cover wounds and
                                    release therapeutic molecules passively is that they typically do not provide much
                                    information about the state of the healing process. The patients, therefore, need to
                                    be continuously monitored by medical professionals.</p><br>

                                <p>In the past, Sonkusale&rsquo;s lab has made a variety of <a
                                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/manufacturing-design/ultrasound-patch-monitors-critical-components">bandages
                                        that detect different conditions</a>, target medication to a wound, and more.
                                    The new bandage combines much of that past work. &ldquo;So with this, we&rsquo;ve
                                    managed to put all of that together,&rdquo; Sonkusale says.</p><br>

                                <p>It&rsquo;s a combination of five or six years of work that started with a National
                                    Science Award to fund work in flexible bioelectronics, an emerging area with broad
                                    implications in advancing basic life sciences and providing new tools for many
                                    clinical applications. Chronic wound management is one of the key application areas
                                    for flexible biomedical systems.</p><br>

                                <p>His smart bandage system is made of multiple components, including sensors for pH and
                                    temperature, a microheater, thermo-responsive drug carriers embedded in a hydrogel
                                    patch, and wireless electronics that read data from the sensors and control the
                                    thermal actuation system for automatically releasing drugs. &nbsp;</p><br>

                                <p align="left">One patch includes the sensors, drug carrier, and microheater. When the
                                    pH of a chronic wound changes from acidic to alkaline, that typically indicates a
                                    bacterial infection. The temperature sensor also provides useful information about
                                    the level of inflammation in and around the wound.</p><br>

                                <p align="left">A separate patch, or module, includes the electronics that records the
                                    sensors&rsquo; signals and powers the heater if needed, which in turn releases the
                                    appropriate amount of drug. The two sit side-by-side on a piece of transparent
                                    medical tape to form a flexible bandage less than 3-mm thick that is secured onto
                                    skin. The electronics patch is reusable after the other bandage patch is discarded.
                                </p><br>

                                <p>This has all been made possible by the emergence of flexible electronics, flexible
                                    fabrication, flexible screen printing, and advancements in hydrogels and
                                    biomaterials, Sonkusale says. While flexible electronics have made many wearable
                                    medical devices possible, not much work has resulted in smart bandages, he says.</p>

                                
                                       
                                <p>Sonkusale&rsquo;s idea was to transform what has been a passive aid into a more
                                    active device that could help reduce the number of trips a patient takes to a
                                    healthcare facility, and to identify and address issues at an early stage with
                                    limited patient or caregiver involvement. People with certain conditions such as
                                    diabetes, those who have suffered traumatic injuries and burns, as well as the
                                    elderly are at particular risk for chronic wounds. Those are generally defined as
                                    wounds that don&rsquo;t progress through the normal stages of healing and show no
                                    significant progress in a month. The immune system, which helps control
                                    inflammation, also becomes weaker as people age.</p><br>

                                <p>&ldquo;The biggest engineering obstacle was how dowe integrate all the different
                                    components into one that maintains flexibility,&rdquo; Sonkusale says. &ldquo;There
                                    were a lot of challenges to make them flexible and able to be applied to the
                                    skin.&rdquo;</p><br>

                                <p>The first step the team tackled was making a list of the various components thought
                                    should be part of the package. The most important consideration was the flexibility
                                    and biocompatibility of the bandage. From a practical standpoint, components were
                                    also selected to keep the bandage low cost and disposable. That was achieved in part
                                    by using screen printing and not having to work inside a clean room. &ldquo;We
                                    don&rsquo;t use expensive equipment,&rdquo; he says.</p><br>

                                <p>According to the team&rsquo;s paper, local targeted delivery of antibiotics is
                                    preferred over oral and topical treatment because it delivers precise and controlled
                                    administration, requires a smaller dose, and prevents damage to nearby healthy
                                    tissue. The wireless communication of data also keeps caregivers informed remotely.
