                            <p>Vikash Kumar, a University of Washington doctoral student in computer science and
                                engineering, is part of a team of researchers making great strides in developing a robot
                                for a human body part that is one of the most difficult areas to replicate with the same
                                functionality: the hand.</p>

                            <p>Kumar grew interested in <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/technology-and-society/giving-a-robot-a-hand">robotics</a>
                                after becoming disillusioned with the study of mathematics because it was only about
                                numbers and equations on the board and on paper. &ldquo;The only way I could appreciate
                                those things was if I could use them in a real-world application. That&rsquo;s when I
                                saw robotics as a means to channel all my learning into something tangible,&rdquo; Kumar
                                says.</p>

                            <p>After earning his bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degrees at the Indian Institute of
                                Technology Kharagpur, he enrolled at UW to study for his doctorate working in the
                                university&rsquo;s Movement Control Lab under the supervision of Professor Emanuel
                                Todorov.</p>

                            <p>The five-fingered hand he and Todorov have built is a breakthrough because it can perform
                                tasks that require highly dexterous manipulation, which traditionally has been very
                                difficult for robots, plus it also can learn from its own experience and build upon that
                                learning without ongoing human direction.</p>

                            <p>Most work with commercial robots has involved software engineers imagining every movement
                                to perform a specific task and then programming those movements. Because of
                                machine-learning algorithms that help the robot model both the basic physics involved
                                and plan which actions it should take to achieve the desired result, the <a

                                gets progressively more adept each time it performs a specific task, eventually learning
                                by experience to respond as quickly as, or even faster than, a human hand.</p>

                            <p>Starting in 2011, Kumar spent two and a half years designing the hand, which has 40
                                tendons, 24 joints, and more than 130 sensors. Then he turned to working with different
                                methods of controlling the hand. &ldquo;I eventually ended up with combining both
                                optimal control and the learning-based method because [combining them] has produced a
                                much better result,&rdquo; he explains. The benefit is that the kind of task that used
                                to take thousands and thousands of trials of iterations now takes orders of magnitude
                                less trial and less data, and this combination gives us an efficient way of learning, he
                                adds.</p>

                            <p>The eventual goal is to have a functional equivalent of the human hand. The grand vision
                                is to have <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/manufacturing-design/robots-reach-for-goals">robots</a>
                                mimic more closely what nature has done in creating what an animal can do, he said.
                                &ldquo;We are on the right track. It will be just a matter of time before we get
                                there,&rdquo; says Kumar.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;Now we have tools good at solving one particular job: a copy machine, a
                                dishwasher, a washing machine. Soon you realize that every task you have to solve is
                                asking for another piece of hardware. That&rsquo;s why a robotic butler is something in
                                the grand vision of robotics because that is one machine that does all the household
                                chores for you,&rdquo; Kumar says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to get a
                                functional equivalent of a human hand because the <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/reaching-with-3d-printed-hands">human
                                    hand</a> is capable of solving various different tasks; it&rsquo;s capable of
                                peeling a label, capable of loading a dishwasher, capable of assembling IKEA furniture.
                                But any one robot right now is good at only one of those.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>To date, the team has demonstrated local learning with the robot, meaning that the hand
                                learns from and improves by performing a task repeatedly. The next step is to tackle
                                global learning, in other words, have the robot figure out how to perform a task with an
                                unfamiliar object or in a new situation it hasn&rsquo;t faced before.</p>

                            <p>Kumar envisions endless possible end uses eventually for the basic technology, everything
                                from defusing explosive devices to <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/precise-prosthetics-for-elite-athletes">prosthetics</a>
                                to space or marine exploration to disaster recovery to health care. But his team&rsquo;s
                                focus will continue to be on developing the fundamental building blocks that underlie
                                all the possible uses, making sure that all the steps involved are in the right
                                sequence.</p>

                            <p>As excited as he is about the breakthrough work his team is doing, he is more excited to
                                see where other scientists around the world may take the basic capability and begin to
                                collaborate and combine their individual expertise for specific uses. He acknowledges
                                that it&rsquo;s not something that is going to happen overnight. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not
                                going to be one day or one month where we say it doesn&rsquo;t work until it works.
                                It&rsquo;s a gradual process, probably five to ten years,&rdquo; Kumar says.</p>

                            <p>But he does expect to see more results starting to come pretty soon as &ldquo;more people
                                jump in now that the problem seems more tractable. We will start to have small but
                                gradual progress from now onwards.&rdquo;</p>
