                        <p>For two long days and nights, Professor Asegun Henry&rsquo;s team of researchers at Georgia
                            Tech&rsquo;s Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering anxiously watched their new ceramic
                            pump move molten tin heated to record-high temperatures. At any moment, they expected
                            something to go wrong. The extreme heat could shatter a shaft, break a bearing, melt a seal,
                            as it did during countless tests conducted throughout the pump&rsquo;s four-year development
                            cycle. The students were forced to monitor the machine in case it started leaking
                            dangerously hot metal. They didn&rsquo;t want to burn down the lab.</p>

                        <p>Henry and his students hoped this test would be different. Over the years, the team developed
                            a number of innovations and improvements to <a

                            others expect to spur a new generation of highly efficient, low-cost systems for storing,
                            transporting, and converting surplus thermal energy produced by renewables like solar and
                            wind. It could serve as a new, cheaper type of battery that could generate electricity when
                            needed, big challenge in the advancement of renewable energy. The nuclear and chemical
                            processing industries, among others, could also use the system for advanced applications.

                        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big undertaking because you have to change the whole infrastructure of
                            the system,&rdquo; Henry says.</p>

                        <p>To handle those needs, the pump had to withstand temperatures that could exceed 1,600 &deg;K
                            (1,326 &deg;C), making it the first of its kind. As testing moved into its third day, the
                            new pump held. Based on past failures, though, the team expected the worst.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>

                        <p>Almost every form of energy conversion creates heat, making it one of the most prevalent
                            forms of energy. When used for mechanical work, thermal energy is most efficient when it can
                            be moved, stored, and converted at its highest possible temperature. But most of
                            today&rsquo;s pumps and compressors can&rsquo;t handle that extreme heat and must be stored
                            in a cooler part of the system, limiting the system&rsquo;s overall efficiency. The
                            components &ndash; usually made from <a
                                href="https://www.asme.org/about-asme/news/asme-news/single-crystal-turbine-blade-named-asmes-265th"
                                title="Single Crystal Turbine Blade Named ASMEâ€™s 265th Landmark">superalloys</a> and
                            ceramics &ndash; break, corrode, weaken, or wear when exposed to high-temperature liquids
                            for an extended period.</p>

                        <p>The need for a stable heat storage and transfer system is especially important for advanced
                            and emerging nuclear energy applications. The system, for example, could serve as a less
                            expensive, more efficient, and faster way to cool down a reactor in case of an emergency.
                            Finding that solution, Henry says, has been a &ldquo;grand challenge&rdquo; in the nuclear
                            energy industry and one of the main reasons the Advanced Research Projects Agency &ndash;
                            Energy (ARPA-E) is funding his work.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;The scary thing with nuclear is the runaway effect, where the reactor heats up faster
                            than you can cool it,&rdquo; Henry says. &ldquo;This type of pump can move heat faster, and
                            the liquid will stay warmer before it boils. That buys you a whole lot of safety.&rdquo;</p>
