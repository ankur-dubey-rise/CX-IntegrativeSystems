<p>Jason Barnes had dreamed of being a professional drummer since he was a teenager. But when he lost part of his right arm in a workplace accident at the age of 22, that goal was put in jeopardy.</p>

<p>Barnes didn&rsquo;t give up. After the accident, he built himself a homemade <a href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/bioengineering/prosthetic-limbs-that-can-feel">prosthetic</a> drumstick; unfortunately that tool didn&rsquo;t give him the control he needed to play at a professional level. Then he teamed up with Gil Weinberg, a professor in Georgia Tech&rsquo;s School of Music and the founding director of the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We got a call from somebody who said one of his students lost his hand and is looking for a myoelectric robotic arm that would allow him to control and play music, almost like a wrist that he didn&rsquo;t have any more,&rdquo; says Weinberg, who is also a musician himself and an inventor of experimental <a href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/applied-mechanics/the-banjo-the-engineers-instrument">musical instruments</a>.</p>

<p>Together they made prosthetics that enable Barnes to continue making music. Not only can he drum, but he can also play the piano and the guitar. For more than a decade, Weinberg had been developing robotic musicians that performed as separate entities&mdash;that is, not attached to the body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea was to have artificial <a href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/technology-and-society/ai-learns-to-forget">creativity algorithms</a> driving these <a href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/robotics">robots</a>,&quot; says Weinberg. &quot;They listen like human, understand rhythm and beat, but when they improvise they use genetic algorithms to create music.&rdquo; One of his most popular robots has been &ldquo;Shimon,&rdquo; a marimba-playing robot that uses artificial intelligence and creativity algorithms to listen to, understand, and collaborate with human musicians.</p>

<p>The goal for Barnes was different. Although it is possible to drum with only one arm&mdash;notably, drummer Rick Allen continued performing for the rock group Def Leppard after a 1984 car accident took his left arm&mdash;Barnes wanted a prosthetic that would allow him to play drums very quickly and with great accuracy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since he wanted the capability to flex and relax his muscle so that he can control the type of stick that&rsquo;s being held, we put electomyographic sensors on the muscle, to make it tighter or looser,&rdquo; Weinberg says. The hardware in the arm, according to Weinberg, uses two motors to boost dexterity and speed. The software includes a genetic algorithm, neural network, and deep learning to convert the signals from Barnes&rsquo;s muscles into movement of the drumsticks.</p>

<p>The success Barnes had with his prosthetic prompted Weinberg&rsquo;s team to build an auxiliary arm that attaches to the shoulder and is controlled via brain signals. They have also used similar AI techniques to develop a prosthetics hand dexterous enough to enable Barnes to play the piano.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This technology can be used for anything that requires finger-to-finger dexterous control,&rdquo; says Weinberg, who hopes to commercialize it. The human-robot collaboration has been life-changing for Barnes, who is now a traveling musician. He has performed on stage, including at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, and internationally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doomsayers talk about robots taking away your jobs,&rdquo; Weinberg says, &ldquo;and here is one example where the human won&rsquo;t have a job without robotics.&rdquo;</p>
