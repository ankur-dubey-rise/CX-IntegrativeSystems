<!-- End of Brightcove Player --><p>Welcome to the fourth episode of&nbsp;<em>ASME TechCast</em>, a new podcast brought to you by the editors of ASME.org and&nbsp;<em>Mechanical Engineering</em>&nbsp;magazine that brings you the innovators, innovations, and issues that push the envelope of engineering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week we speak with Evelyn Wang, who was recently named the head of MIT&rsquo;s Department of Mechanical Engineering. We talk about some of the new educational models and grand research challenges she&rsquo;s implementing into the curriculum and how those impact the way mechanical engineering is being taught not only at MIT but in other universities as well.</p>

<p>We also feature a segment by Chitra Sethi, <em>Mechanical Engineering</em> magazine&rsquo;s managing editor, who reports on MIT&rsquo;s new $1-billion Stephen A. Schwarzman&nbsp;College of Computing and how AI, big data and other technologies are changing the curriculum at the some of the largest colleges in the country.</p>
