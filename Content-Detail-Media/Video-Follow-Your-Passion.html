	Walmy Cuello Jimenez, PE, Sr. Technical Professional at Halliburton grew up in a small town of about 5,000 people in northern Colombia. At the time of his high school graduation, about 25 people graduated from high school per year and only 30% or less went on to attend college. Walmy had to embrace many changes and challenges to get to where he is today. He stepped outside of his comfort zone to challenge the status quo of someone with a similar background and decided to pursue graduate education in a different country. Walmy&rsquo;s experience has taught him that the world is constantly evolving and that change is far from easy. His passion for engineering, the desire for career advancement, seeking new challenges and setting new goals has helped him to have a successful career.</p>
