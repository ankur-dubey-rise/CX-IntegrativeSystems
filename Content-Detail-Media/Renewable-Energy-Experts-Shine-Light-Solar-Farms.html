<!-- End of Brightcove Player --><p>Welcome to the fifth episode of&nbsp;<em>ASME TechCast</em>, a new podcast brought to you by the editors of ASME.org and&nbsp;<em>Mechanical Engineering</em>&nbsp;magazine that brings you the innovators, innovations, and issues that push the envelope of engineering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this week&rsquo;s show, Chitra Sethi, managing editor of <em>Mechanical Engineering</em> magazine, speaks with Frank Bergh, the former vice president of grid engineering at Sigora International and current CEO of Beyond the Grid, a renewable energy consulting company, and Alison Kling, a project specialist at Con Edison. The three talk about the challenges and benefits of creating solar farms in New York City and a solar grid in Haiti, as well as the current and&nbsp;future states of renewable energy sources. But first, Jeffrey Winters, <em>Mechanical Engineering </em>magazine&rsquo;s senior editor, talks about the bad climate news that dominated 2018, which just may be a reason to create more renewable energy sources in 2019.</p>
