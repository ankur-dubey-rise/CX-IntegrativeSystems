<!-- End of Brightcove Player --><p>Welcome to the first segment of&nbsp;<em>ASME TechCast</em>, a new podcast brought to you by the editors of ASME.org and <em>Mechanical Engineering</em> magazine that brings you the innovators, innovations, and issues that push the envelope of engineering. In this episode&nbsp;we talk with Roma Agrawal, a structural engineer and the author of the new book <em>Built: The Hidden Stories Behind our Structures</em>.</p>

<p>During her 10-year career, Agrawal has designed bridges, skyscrapers, and sculptures. When she&rsquo;s not designing, she spends much of her time promoting engineering careers to young people, especially women. Agrawal recently spoke with Jeff O&rsquo;Heir, ASME&rsquo;s senior content manager, about her book and the need for a wide representation of cultures and views in engineering. Read a text version of the interview <a href="~/engineering-topics/articles/technology-and-society/building-case-diversified-engineering-workforce">here</a>.</p>
